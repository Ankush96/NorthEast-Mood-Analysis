But if the peace in Nagaland is at the cost of our territories than we won`t let it happen,"" Ninon Ering, Member of Parliament from East Arunachal Pradesh, told IANS.He said It should be understood that Nagas staying in any other state apart from Nagaland ""are an integral part of that state as they have been staying there for years. Where does the demand for other states to give up its Naga-inhabited areas come from?"" he asked.Noting that there were only four Naga tribes living in Arunachal Pradesh, including the Wancho, Tangsa and Nocte, Ering said: ""At most the government can allow them to have autonomous councils, but giving up those areas to Nagaland won`t be possible.""

He added that the government should have at least informed Parliament before signing the accord with the NSCN-IM. ""Discussing in Parliament with all stake-holders was necessary,"" he added.Nagaland shares its boundary with Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.

The peace accord should be completely in the interest of the Nagas regardless of whichever North-Eastern states they might be living in,"" Zhimomi said.""Why should they object to the Naga inhabited land being given to form Greater Nagaland? We are only demanding our ancestoral lands in the neighbouring states where the Naga tribes have been staying for centuries,"" said Zhimomi.On Tuesday, former Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio had told IANS: ""The demand for Greater Nagaland is the main demand of the NSCN - irrespective of which faction it is.

There still are demands from the NSCN-IM to be allowed to carry arms, especially in areas where it has a presence.""Now this might be basically to protect themselves from attacks by rival factions. But the government is yet to decide on this demand,"" Rio, who served as Nagaland chief minister for three consecutive terms, told a news agency in an interview.Rio is in Delhi to attend the ongoing monsoon session of parliament.The 64-year-old leader of the Naga People's Front (NPF), who gave up his chief ministership to become the lone Lok Sabha member from Nagaland, also said the government and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) have decided on a time-frame under which they expect to decide on all the demands.Refuting media reports that the government did not accept the NSCN-IM's demand to redraw the state's border to incorporate Naga-inhabited areas of Assam, Manipur and Arunachal, he said: ""The demand for Greater Nagaland is the main demand of the NSCN -- irrespective of which faction it is. The question of dropping that demand does not arise as this is what the conflict is all about.""""Demand for Greater Nagaland is part of the 16-point demand in the agreement by the NSCN-IM. I do not think it is going to be dropped. However, let's see what happens,"" said Rio, adding that every thing would be clear once the minutes of the accord are out, which he believes would take some time.In a surprising but historic move, the NSCN-IM and the government on Monday signed the Naga Peace Accord settling an almost 20-year-old peace negotiation process that started in 1997 after the group signed the ceasefire agreement.NSCN-IM general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah, who signed the accord on Monday at a ceremony at the prime minister's 7 Race Course Road residence, hailed it as a ""momentous occasion"".Asked what if the other factions of NSCN do not give a positive response to the peace accord that was signed on Monday, Rio said: ""The Naga Peace Accord is based on the basis of principles of the NSCN which is the same. There is still room for discussion with other factions and the government will surely talk with the other factions also. They will be brought to the negotiation table.""Apart from the NSCN-IM, there are three other major factions involved in the insurgency in the state. These are NSCN-K, NSCN-U and NSCN-KZ -- and experts aver that they are unlikely to accept the newly-signed peace accord.Rio said Prime Minister Narendra Modi called him on Monday evening and spoke to him about how to solve problems related to Nagaland further.Refuting rumours about Isak Chisi Swu not being consulted on the final agreement of the Naga Accord due to his deteriorating health, he said: ""Swu was informed about each and every minute development related to the issue and even general secretary T Muivah had spoken to him prior to the ceremony at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's residence.""NSCN-IM chairman Swu was admitted to a Delhi-based hospital on July 5 after he suffered renal failure. The 85-year-old leader underwent surgery on July 14 and is said to be recovering."

It's a legacy of the British rule,” the PM said.He said there were not many like Mahatma Gandhi, ""who loved the Naga people and were sensitive to their sentiments. We have continued to look at each other through the prism of false perceptions and old prejudices.""“Today we mark not merely the end of a problem but the beginning of a new future. Today, to the people of Nagaland I want to say that your talents, tradition and efforts will make the nation stronger,” the PM added.He said further, ""We will not only try to heal wounds and resolve problems, but also be your partner as you restore your pride and prestige.""""Today's agreement is a shining example of what we can achieve when we deal with each other in a spirit of equality and respect, trust and confidence; when we seek to understand concerns and try to address aspirations; when we leave the path of dispute and take the high road of dialogue. It is a lesson and an inspiration in our troubled world,"" the Prime Minister said.Stating that violence has never solved any problem, PM Modi said, “Since becoming Prime Minister last year, peace, security and economic transformation of the Northeast has been amongst my highest priorities.”Before the agreement was signed in the evening, Modi spoke to leaders of various parties including former PM Manmohan Singh, Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, BSP's Mayawati, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury.He also spoke to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Tamil Nadu counterpart J Jayalalithaa besides the Nagaland Governor Padmanabha Acharya and Chief Minister TR Zeliang.

The people of Manipur were expecting a stringent law besides preventing migrants from land ownership right.

"154","'NSCN-K abrogated ceasefire under Paresh Baruah's influence'","July 6, 2015","New Delhi: The Khaplang faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-K) abrogated the ceasefire deal with the Indian government under the influence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah, according to two former leaders of the NSCN-K.Wangtin Naga and P Tikhak, leaders of a new organisation called NSCN (Reformation), said that it was at United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) leader Baruah's instance that NSCN-K leader SS Khaplang expelled them from the organisation as kilonsers (ministers) and abrogated the ceasefire deal.In an interview with the Northeast Sun magazine, Naga and Tikhak said that they were shocked to learn of their expulsion on March 27, the same day that they were attending the ceasefire meeting with the Indian government at Chumukedima in Nagaland.“It was a real shock to us. As usual we had to attend the ceasefire meeting on March 27 which was fixed about 20 days ago. You know we keep on having these ceasefire review meetings after a gap of every two or three months. So to attend the meeting on March 27, I started from Mon (in Nagaland) on March 26 with a plan to spend the night at Jorhat (in Assam),” Wangtin said. “Soon after crossing the Nagaland-Assam border gate I received a phone call from an Army officer on my mobile who informed me that our boys have carried out a shootout in Kohima and a bomb blast in Wokha. It really shocked me and I told the officer that I do not know. That Army officer did not believe me and accused me by saying, 'Your boys have done it. How can you say that you don’t know?'” He said that he was intercepted on the way at a place called Sonari and was kept in Army custody for around six hours before being released at the intervention of the Indian Home Ministry.The next day, March 27, he said he was driving down to Dimapur for the meeting when he came to know that the NSCN-K had fired at one captain of the Assam Rifles on the orders of Niki Sema, a “lieutenant general” under Khaplang “to complicate the situation more”.According to Wangtin, when he and Tikhak reached Chumukedima, everybody present there from the Indian side were initially not willing to listen to them or conduct the meeting because they said that the ceasefire had already broken down. “Tikhak and myself, we tried to defend Khaplang and told them that Khaplang might not have committed these acts on the security forces, that he might not have authorised anybody to fire upon Indian security forces. I am the ceasefire convenor and Tikhak being the member of the committee, we would have been the first ones to be informed if Khaplang had wished to break the ceasefire,” he said.But on May 28, he said, he and Tikhak were shocked to see a statement by Khaplang in all the local newspapers that the ceasefire was officially abrogated and the two of them have been expelled from the NSCN-K for attending the ceasefire meeting.“Ceasefire meeting is an usual exercise for us but Khaplang never informed us about this situation. If Khaplang had any plan to break the ceasefire he should have consulted his Cabinet kilonsers and workers and accordingly he should have informed me and Tikhak,” Wangtin, who along with Tikhak, was in New Delhi for talks with the Indian authorities said, adding that “Khaplang must have been the victim of manipulation by somebody”.Asked how he viewed his and Wangtin's expulsion, Tikhak said that “some people, particularly like Paresh Barua” might be behind this.According to Tikhak, Barua, after being expelled from Bangladesh, Barua came to Myanmar and took refuge with Khaplang.“Paresh with his men came to Myanmar and took refuge with Khaplang. Since then they started misguiding Khaplang. We stood for peace and did not support ULFA’s actions like killing innocent school children in Dhemaji and bomb blasts in the markets where innocent people were killed. We have always been opposed to them on such actions,” Tikhak said. When pointed out that there was a theory doing the rounds that under Chinese influence, Barua was instrumental in convincing Khaplang to abrogate the ceasefire with India, Tikhak said: “Even in the killings of adivasis in Bodo areas by the Bodo group (National Democratic Front of Bodoloand-Songbijit), ULFA played a role. Probably it routed through other agency from other country, particularly the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan). That is what we know and have been told. Now Chinese involvement, we cannot rule out. But at the same time we can’t prove it. But to be precise, we cannot rule out their (Chinese) involvement.”Wangtin said that he 75 percent did not agree with Khaplang and stood for the ceasefire. “The day Khaplang expelled me and Tikhak, we decided to continue the ceasefire. Our expulsion by Khaplang is nothing but is as (sic) cutting his own legs.”"

But at the entrance of the village are men in uniform - soldiers who question the scribes about the ""purpose of your visit"".Entry into the village was possible after a long ""explanation"" to the men in uniform, who reminded the journalists that ""we also have human rights"".The pets looked horribly starved. If not taken care in the next few days, they will not survive.There is no one to feed them as every single villager fled Paraolon village immediately after the ambush, fearing military reprisals.More than a fortnight later, the fear is yet to subside.Not merely Paraolon but the neighbouring villages of Charlon and Kotal Khuntak are also totally deserted.A few hours after the ambush, the residents of these villages, fearing reprisals from the army during its combing operations, started fleeing from their homestead and now the villages lie completely abandoned.After almost two weeks, the security forces have granted access to the media beyond the ambush site, which had remained virtually under siege ever since the incident.A team of mediapersons under the All Manipur Working Journalists Union Thursday toured the affected villages.During the tour, the team could still see the charred army trucks, belongings of the soldiers, bullet projectiles and burnt bushes at the ambush site.The two trucks charred during the ambush and full of bullet holes remain stationed at Paraolon village.One truck was carrying six barrels of fuel and edible oil when the 6 Dogra Regiment convoy was attacked by the combined team of undergrounds.In Paraolon village, as soon as the media team stepped out of their vehicles, a hunting dog approached them, which is uncommon in normal times.These hunting dogs are considered quite aggressive and don't welcome strangers.However, the dog was in a pitiable condition, left unattended by its owners for the past fortnight or so. Its bones were sticking to the skin.All houses at Paraolon were deserted while some abandoned domestic animals followed the scribes silently, perhaps looking for something to eat.One starving cat had died and its decomposed body was found inside a room.Along the 15-km stretch from Paraolon to Moltuk there are only four villages - Paraolon, Charlon, Kotal Khunthak and Moltuk - separated by a few kilometres each.The residents of Moltuk, a Kuki village 10 km from the ambush site, decided to stay back. The other three are inhabited by the Lamkang Naga tribes - just 90 households altogether - and the inmates feared reprisals because the Khaplang group of the NSCN had claimed responsibility for the ambush.""We were asked by army personnel not to venture out far from our village even to attend to our fields, hunting or other activities which are necessary for existence. We are now running low on our food stock,"" said Moltuk resident Kunkhothong.The state government had ""failed to protect the people"", he added.Once in a week the residents are allowed to fetch essential commodities in a bus that is run by the village chief. All schools and shops are also closed.It is learnt that some residents of the other three villages have met state officials in the district headquarters for providing security to enable them return home.It has not helped so far.But the question is: How long can they stay away?"

I think that is the biggest strength in us,"" he said adding whenever there is any kind of disruption in the environment of peace, common people do not approve of it.The union minister appealed to the media to join in the effort of the government in ushering in peace and development in the region.When asked for his comment on NSCN(K)'s attack on the Army in Manipur that claimed 18 lives and others in the recent past, the DoNER minister said he did not want to discuss that matter as it is for the ministry of home affairs and other agencies to take a call on it.""As far as I am concerned, I would like to appeal that all of us have a stake in peace. Therefore I also wish to brush aside any misgivings and apprehension that may have come up during the last few days in the wake of what happened in the last week,"" he said.When asked on the status of inquiry ordered by his ministry on the alleged misutilisation of Rs 900 crore central fund by Arunachal Pradesh government, he said that the ministry had received a complaint.""Whatever happened as a follow up to this will be let known to you know in due course of time,"" he said.Responding to a query on central package for the mountain state in the wake of heavy damage wrought due to recent rains and landslides, Singh said he had a detailed discussion on the issue with the state administration led by Chief Secretary Ramesh Negi on the issue.The ministry of road transport and highway is already in touch with the state government, he added. "

So, the strike was again delayed by a day and finalised for early Tuesday morning.The Prime Minister was briefed about the operation after his arrival from Bangladesh on Sunday night and got his final clearance.Meanwhile, the Army Chief undertook a visit to Manipur.During the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, the special forces personnel were air-dropped deep inside the Myanmar territory, closer to the camps of the militants, and the strike started at 3 O'clock yesterday.Sources said as of now, as per the ground reports, 38 militants were killed and seven others were injured in the strike.(With PTI inputs)"

The 'hot pursuit' came days after 18 Army soldiers were killed in a militant strike in Manipur's Chandel district.Subscribe To Zee News onBut how did the entire operation unfold?The entire operation was planned meticulously days in advance with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Army Chief Dalbir Singh Suhag camping in Manipur and monitoring the preparation of the blueprint at the minuscule level.In fact, NSA Doval did not even accompany Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bangladesh during his recent visit and instead focussed his energies on planning the surgical operation – the first of its kind conducted by the Indian armed forces.The Army Chief is also believed to have postponed his UK visit for the operation.Also, the 'hot pursuit' had full backing from the Prime Minister who wanted to send out a strong message.The surgical operation began early Tuesday morning at around 3 am.Specifically-trained Para commandos of the Indian Army were inserted into the Myanmar territory with the help of IAF choppers at two separate locations along the Manipur and Nagaland borders. The commandos then trekked towards the militant camps to retain the element of surprise.The commandos engaged two separate groups of insurgents - some of them believed to be part of the militant group that attacked soldiers of the 6 Dogra Regiment in Manipur's Chandel last week.The entire operation that involved heavy exchange of fire lasted for about 45 minutes and officially, 15 to 20 militants were killed in the operation.However, sources put the toll at 30 and there is even speculation that over 100 militants could have been killed as some 150 were believed to be present at the two camps when the strikes began.There was no casualty on the Indian side and all the commandoes returned to the Indian side of border safely.While officially, the Myanmarese government and its Army were kept informed of the Indian operation, some reports claim that the Indian Ambassador in Nay Pyi Taw apprised the Myanmarese authorities of the same only shortly before the strikes were over. Also, Myanmar's Army was sent a message after the operation was completed, reports added.Myanmar is unlikely to protest the Indian move as both countries have a treaty in place that allows such operations across the border.Army Statement on Mil Ops this morning along Indo-Myanmar border in Nagaland and Manipur.

It depends on which way you look at it.Officials in Left-ruled Tripura maintain that the poor parents, who already had three children, did not sell the infant for a mere Rs 4,500 but ""gifted"" him to a childless couple living in the Madhabbari area of the Mandai block in west Tripura district.As a controversy erupted, the authorities ""rescued"" the newborn with an NGO's help a week later and lodged him at a government-run shelter, away from his biological as well as adoptive parents. The incident was reported from the remote tribal-dominated Munda Basti, 125 km north of Agartala.Ironically, the week-old newborn's fate is still in the hands of the biological parents who ""sold"" the child in the first place, since they would soon be asked by authorities if they wish to raise the infant on their own or not.""When my wife was three months pregnant, we asked a local government doctor to abort the foetus.

The adoptive parents admitted that they gave a few thousand rupees to the biological parents,"" he maintained.""The whole process was videotaped and statements of both the couples were recorded,"" Roy Chowdhury said.The Congress demanded a Below Poverty Line (BPL) card for the poor tribal couple to ensure governmental support to it.Tripura Congress president Birajit Sinha, who met the tribal couple, had a different take on the incident.""The family admitted they sold the child as it was extremely impossible for them to feed the newborn out of the family's very meagre income. We had earlier heard of such incidents in other states of India. But we are now witnessing child trade in Tripura,"" said Sinha, a legislative assembly member and a former minister.""The adoptive couple even gave an advance of Rs 1,000 to the infant's biological mother when she was eight-month pregnant,"" Sinha maintained.Child Line official Prasanna Chakraborty, who was part of the team that rescued the child, told IANS.

The state government also built big tourist lodges there for the tourists.The 'Mukta Manch'(open forum), a forum of environmentalists, intellectuals, academicians and renowned citizens, had demanded to publish a white paper on the status of Rudrasagar and Neermahal, second of its kind in India after lake palace in Rajasthan's Udaipur.""We have urged Chief Minister Manik Sarkar to personally intervene into the matter and take suitable action to protect the heritage building,"" said 'Mukta Manch' convener and writer, Arun Nath.""The central government had sanctioned Rs.1.6 million for afforestation around the Rudrasagar area, but the forest department diverted the money,"" Nath alleged.He said the palace and lake still draw thousands of visitors every year despite the poor condition of the lake which has become shallow because of heavy deposit of silt.At the end of several hundred years of rule by 184 kings, on October 15, 1949, the erstwhile princely state Tripura came under the control of the Indian government according to a merger agreement signed between Kanchan Prabha Devi, then regent maharani, and the governor general of India.The merger agreement made it obligatory for the Tripura government to continue the sponsorship of several temples run earlier by Hindu princely rulers. And it continues to do so to this day.According to the 1949 merger agreement, Neermahal is the personal property of the royal family."

That is the routine drill after any incident,"" Indian Army sources aware of developments told IANS. The ambush site, in fact, is just 10 km from the Myanmar border.The army has been tight-lipped over the situation and its plans in the area, which the army chief, Gen. Dalbir Singh, visited on Friday, but sources say a massive exercise is on to cull out more information on the insurgents.""Information is being culled out... The advanced nature of weapons used in the attack shows some international terror organisation is backing the insurgents,"" a highly placed source told IANS.Experts said that unless there are combing operations on both sides of the border, the terrorists can't be stopped.Lieutenant General Syed Ata Hasnain (retd) cited the example of Operation Golden Bird that was launched in 1995.""As a result of this incident, the overall security environment received renewed energy; it is inevitable after a negative incident and especially of such intensity. The group that launched the attack is probably back in Myanmar,"" Hasnain told IANS.""Trans-IB (International Border) operations are not launched by the Indian Army but it is heartening to hear that the Indian government is planning to approach its counterpart in Myanmar to conduct joint operations on both sides of the border and proactively target the militant camps known to exist in Myanmar's jungles. This approach should be immediate,"" he said.""Under pressure from either side, the militants take to the security of the jungles across the border; hence the necessity to launch coordinated operations. In 1995, India and Myanmar launched Operation Golden Bird, in which they coordinated operations while remaining on their sides. When both armies are alert and step up operations, the militants remain in a dilemma,"" he added.Operation Golden Bird was aimed at flushing out ULFA, NSCN and Manipuri fighters in camps along the border. The ULFA lost several top leaders and cadres like Monpa Rongpi and Madhurya Gohain, but the operation ended abruptly.India and Myanmar share an unfenced 1,643-km border and permit a ""free movement"" regime of up to 16 km on either side.Brig. S.K. Chatterji (retd) meanwhile pointed out that the leaders of several insurgent groups had travelled to China some time back, indicating Beijing's possible involvement.""Around a month-and-a-half back, leaders of all these insurgent groups travelled to China... We may possibly see a surge in attacks in the near future,"" Chatterji told IANS.In Thursday's incident, a group of insurgents that came into India from Myanmar launched an attack on a four-vehicle convoy that was leaving after being de-inducted and was on its way to Imphal.The militants attacked the lead vehicle of the convoy with a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) and the maximum casualties were from this vehicle.The National Socialist Council of Nagaland-K led by S.S. Khaplang has claimed responsibility for the killings along with the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL) and the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP).The newly-formed umbrella group is known as United Liberation Front of West South East Asia (UNLFW).The National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB) Songabijit faction, the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation are among those in the grouping.Hasnain, however, questioned why despite the army's operations since decades, the government had failed to bring lasting peace in the northeast.""The real point is that the army and Assam Rifles have ensured peace in the northeast for the last 20 years. Why has the nation not been able to take this forward,"" he asked.""The army can take the process up to a level. Beyond that, the political process has to take over. There has been a ceasefire in Nagaland for almost 17 years and a halt of operations with specific groups in Manipur for many years. What do we intend to do with the ceasefire?

Singh has also expressed concern over the fact that the state government had ""failed"" to release the matching state's share either in full or in part as a result of which as many as 15 projects are running behind schedule and utilisation certificates were pending in 20 cases, the release quoted the Minister as saying."

They don't like resumption of rebel violence because that will mean military operations again which affects their normal lives. So Khaplang stands isolated,"" Lt Gen Rawat told a news agency.He admitted that Khaplang is sheltering Assamese, Bodo, and Manipuri rebel factions at his base area in Myanmar's Sagaing province.""Other Naga rebel factions and political groups have no stomach for fresh violence, as they have got used to peace. So they are determined to keep his fighters out of Nagaland,"" Lt Gen Rawat said.Khaplang had earlier alleged that Indian intelligence is using other Naga rebel factions in India to block his fighters because these factions have given up the demand for Naga independence.Lt Gen Rawat said the Indian Army will handle the fresh rebel challenge in northeast ""very differently"".""We have built up a people-friendly image over the last 17 years of ceasefire in Nagaland and other parts of the northeast.

Today, there are over 21 outfits.

The separatist groups have been targeting the police and security officials,"" said a senior home ministry official in New Delhi.The northeastern states, are connected to the rest of the country by a thin sliver of land, and contain diverse ethnic groups, some with links to neighbouring Myanmar.Militant activity surged in the states, known as ""the Seven Sisters"", last year with 465 deaths reported, up from 252 a year earlier, according to the South Asian Terrorism Portal, a think-tank that tracks militancy.In Assam, the death toll tripled to 305, making 2014 the state`s worst year since 2009. Only nine people were killed last year in Arunchal Pradesh.The special powers for ""disturbed areas"" was first used in 1958 to control Naga separatists, and was subsequently extended to most of the north-east. It has been in force in the disputed region of Kashmir since 1990.Human rights groups blame AFSPA for a host of extra-judicial killings and arbitrary detentions by security forces. On Wednesday, lawmakers in Kashmir called for it to be repealed.Citizens from the rest of India require a permit to visit Arunchal Pradesh, which is the size of Austria, and heavily militarised along parts of border with China.China has not responded to the new measure, but Beijing has become increasingly vocal in recent years about India`s control of the region it calls South Tibet. "

His term would have ended in 2017.Qureshi last year filed a petition before the Supreme Court alleging the Narendra Modi government was putting pressure on him to give up his post.Qureshi's case was reportedly referred to a five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court as it involves constitutional law related to removal of Governors. The bench is yet to be formed.Tempers are running high in Mizoram over the frequent transfers of Governors.This started with Vakkom B Purushothaman, who was asked to go to Nagaland on July 6, 2014, just a month after Modi became the prime minister.Purushothaman resigned, claiming he was not consulted over his transfer.

If this is completed, Tawang will have much better connectivity with Guwahati. The travel time will reduce by six hours and travel distance will reduce by 200 kilometres,"" Arunachal Pradesh Tourism Minister Pema Khandu told PTI here.The distance between strategically important Tawang to Guwahati, which is the hub of resources in Northeast, is 600 kilometres and is covered after over 16 hours of arduous road journey through Bhalukpong and Tezpur. The hilly road also includes crossing of Sela Pass which is at an altitude of about 14,000 ft and is closed in rough weather.""The road through Lumla-Tashigang will be a much easier affair than crossing Sela Pass. It will not only help Tawang residents to reach Guwahati but also help in reopening the age old border trade between Bhutan and Tawang,"" Khandu said.People here are dependant on Guwahati which is the main source of good medical facilities and rail connectivity in the North Eastern region. The costly helicopter service is dependant on fickle weather which frequently changes and brings air traffic to a halt."

We are expressing displeasure over the conduct of the state government,"" a bench comprising Justices Ranjan Gogoi and R F Nariman said. The bench directed the Chief Secretary to file a ""meaningful affidavit"" within a week on the steps taken in pursuant to its December 17, 2014 order. The bench said the failure to file a proper affidavit would lead to calling of the state's chief secretary for explanation. It also directed the Assam Government to apprise it about the steps taken to comply with its direction to meet the deadline of January 2016 for updating of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). At the outset, the bench expressed its anguish over the affidavit filed by a junior official and asked ""does he know anything what is going on?"" ""See the seriousness with which this matter is treated,"" it said adding that ""shall we call this man and ask what is there in the affidavit? Does he know what is there?"" The bench was also at pain to say that despite assurances 500 police units and task force to detect illegal migrants have not been activated within a month. ""Affidavit says that steps taken for constitution of 500 units of task force, but they are not yet in place,"" the bench observed, noting that three months have passed since the judgement was delivered with a slew of directions both for the state and the Centre. ""The fact has been that you have dragged your feet. We will say your affidavit is highly unsatisfactory worth not accepting. We will call your chief secretary. This is not the way. You have dragged your feet for years and years and still dragging,"" the bench observed during the hearing."

There are families whose women cannot be misbehaved with as people fear them. Similarly, people should fear you as well,"" Punia said.""Fear should be such that people should tremble out of it. The Dimapur lynching incident was bad but in certain way it was good as such people will be scared (after this incident). To generate this sort of fear, Baba Saheb had said that be organised. He wanted us to be organised in such a way that nobody can think of victimising us,"" he added.He was speaking at the launch of Atrocity Tracking and Monitoring System (ATM), a unique system where members of the two communities can complain about any atrocity meted out to them through SMS.The system has been developed by National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ). A victim or any activist working for them can send an SMS by typing 'NCSPOA' and send it to 9898915455. The service involves the generation of an SMS which would be received by the respective state member organisation for taking action on the information received.The registered user organisations can then send SMS to the case related officials from the ATM web page after which the complaint will be received by the government officials for speeding up the legal process.Punia hailed the efforts of NDMJ for the introduction of the website and slammed the government for not doing enough to tackle the problems of the people.""The government has totally failed to develop such a system like you all have done. I would urge the Home Minister that Independence is not worth if the people are not getting their right to speak,"" Punia said.The website has sections like reports and fact findings and one can easily track status of a case through the system.""The system enables a registered user to upload fact finding cases as intervened by Dalit human right activists and organistaions in previous years as case studies in order to maintain a comprehensive database of the atrocity cases thus helping to amplify the efforts of human rights organisations,"" said one of the organisers.  "

Nayak told IANS.""The PGCIL erected the vital transmission line from Biswanath Chariali in Assam to Agra for Rs.11,000 crore,"" he added.According to the official, the transmission line would be capable of transmitting 6,000 MW of electricity.The PGCIL, a ""Navaratna"" power transmission company, also signed a 10-year agreement with the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited to provide an underground telecommunication cable link in the northeastern region.The northeast is going to be power surplus and it was an enormous problem to transmit the excess power from the region to the country's power-starved regions. The eight northeastern states' off-peak and peak demand on an average is 1,500 MW to 2,500 MW against the current installed capacity of 4,730 MW.The installed capacity, according to electrical engineers and government documents, would increase significantly before the next year-end after the completion of several mega hydro-electric, coal and gas-based power plants.Several mega hydro power projects are now under commissioning in Arunachal Pradesh, which could be called India's power house if its enormous resources could be tapped.These include the 110 MW Pare project and the 600 MW Kameng project being commissioned by the North East Electrical Power Corporation (NEEPCO). While Pare is expected to be commissioned this year, Kameng will be commissioned next year. Work on the third one - the 2,000 MW Lower Subansiri project - is expected to begin soon.State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has commissioned its biggest commercial power project of 726 MW at Palatana in southern Tripura, 60 km south of Agartala, while NEEPCO is setting up a 101 MW project at Monarchak in western Tripura, 70 km south of Agartala and only eight km from the India-Bangladesh border.According to union power ministry documents, the hydro-power potential of the northeastern region is estimated at about 58,971 MW, which is almost 40 percent of the country's potential. But only about 2.1 percent (1,242 MW) had been harnessed till last May.The region is home to a 151.68 billion cubic metre reserve of natural gas which is capable of generating 7,500 MW of electricity for 10 years. The region also possesses 864.78 million tonnes of coal against the country's reserves of 186 billion tonnes - enabling about 240 MW of power to be generated for 100 years.""NEEPCO is also planning to generate at least 1,500 MW from non-conventional sources of energy such as solar and wind in the next five years,"" its chairman and managing director P.C. Pankaj told IANS.Pankaj said NEEPCO has also undertaken several other power projects with a generation capacity more than 5,000 MW in Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. ""These projects would start generation of power within the next eight years.""The central government, on Tripura's request, has decided to supply 100 MW of power to Bangladesh.""To take power from Tripura, a new 24-km transmission line would be erected on the Indian side and a 27-km one on the Bangladesh side. The PGCIL would erect the line on the Indian side and the Bangladesh Power Development Board would do a similar job on its side,"" Nayak said, adding that the company would invest Rs.80 crore on this.He said that the new line would be ready by this year-end and 100 MW of power from ONGC's Palatana plant can immediately be supplied to Bangladesh.While erecting the new line from western Tripura's Surjyamaninagar to Comilla in eastern Bangladesh, human habitations, forest and other vital installations would be avoided."
