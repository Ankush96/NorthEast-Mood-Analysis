1,BJP to contest GHADC polls,"Monday, August 24, 2015","SHILLONG: In a bid to test its strength in the State the BJP has decided to field candidates for the October 12 GHADC polls.
The party had shown impressive performance in Shillong constituencies and also in parts of Jaintia Hills during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. However, it did not field any candidate in Tura for the polls.

2,Drug users doubling up as peddlers worry police,"Monday, August 24, 2015","SHILLONG: The trend of drug users turning peddlers in parts of the city has become a worrying factor for the State Police which is making all out efforts to contain the menace.
The worry is that a drug user himself is turning out to be a supplier so that he can earn more money and sustain himself to carry on with his addiction, Shillong City SP Vivek Syiem told reporters recently.
Other factors which are worrisome are the growing instances of use of drugs by minors including girls, he said.
With lack of parental care and support, easy availability of money and temptation from likeminded groups, there is a rise in the number of drug users among students, both boys and girls in the State, police admit.
The East Khasi Hills Police is trying its best to tackle the menace which has become a bigger threat than militancy and spread of HIV.
“There is an overall degeneration of values which result in the current trend of drug abuse, Syiem said.
Sources said that the major reason for the youths to go astray is the frustration due to the loss of family values and the fall out of the current political and social system.
“The parents have no time to spend with their wards which result in children withdrawing from the parental care and finding solace in drugs and other forms of addictions as escape routes,” Syiem said.
According to police, there is a need to check the trend of users of drugs becoming suppliers of contraband items.
It will be a hard task for the police to find out the source of supply of drugs as there is a varied chain leading to neighboring countries.
Police are trying to find out the source of narcotics which, however, ultimately needs the support of neighbouring states and countries.
The danger is that first time users can fall prey to the addiction which in the long run will be difficult to overcome.
“A person who takes drugs for the first time does not know that gradually he will become a drug addict and several instances of first-timers prove that they become addicts within a short period of time,” Syiem added.
According to police, affluent cities are falling prey to drugs abuse which can be controlled by concerted efforts of the parents of those who are addicted to drugs and the law enforcers."
3,Tetelia-Byrnihat rail project work drops off pace,"Monday, August 24, 2015","SHILLONG: Work for the Tetelia-Byrnihat railway project has slowed down due to the ongoing monsoon season and is likely gain pace only by November.
Officials from the Northeast Frontier Railways said that the earth cutting work has been stopped in view of the monsoon and currently work is going on in the bridges.
Even though the NFR has targeted to finish the Tetelia-Byrnihat project by March 2017 an official informed that land for the project is yet to be made available.
“We are not getting possession of land in both Assam and Meghalaya. As of now land has been made available only in bits and pieces,” the official said.
However, according to the official the district administration of Ri Bhoi has assured to provide all possible assistance in early handing over of land to the NFR.
The 21.5-km Tetelia-Byrnihat rail is being constructed at an estimated project cost of Rs 385.2 crore. Out of the total 21.5 km, only 2.5 km of the railway track will be in Meghalaya.
On the other hand, the Byrnihat-Shillong railway project may soon see the light of the day as land survey till Lailad, a village around 30 kms from Byrnihat, has been completed and the NFR would soon submit its estimate to the State Government for land acquisition.
It may be mentioned that the railways is targeting to connect all the eight states in India’s North East by 2020 as part of the ‘Mission 2020′ which will be implemented strictly within the stipulated timeframe.
However, pressure groups in Meghalaya are opposed to the idea of introducing railway in the state fearing that it would promote influx of illegal migrants.Only the Garo Hills region of the State falls on country’s railway map thanks to the Dudhnoi-Mendipathar line which was inaugurated last year."

5,Mawthadraishan farmers demand relief package,"Monday, August 24, 2015","NONGSTOIN: Farmers under the Mawthadraishan Block of West Khasi Hills have demanded the State Government to release funds for relief and rehabilitation of those affected by heavy rain and hailstorm in the area.
The cyclone and hailstorm that hit the area in March and April caused great loss to crops and property in West Khasi Hills.
The farmers also accused the government of not taking their plight seriously even as “the sitting MLAs from the area were busy trying to score political points”.
The farmers also alleged that the government was yet to sanction adequate funds for their relief and rehabilitation.
“Even though the authorities are fully aware of our situation, adequate relief has not been given to the affected people”, said N. Syiemiong, a local farmer who had to incur huge losses as his crops were destroyed by the hailstorm in March.

6,Police conducting awareness programmes to tackle cyber crime,"Monday, August 24, 2015","SHILLONG: Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have become part and parcel of the youths’ lives today. The sites especially Facebook, however, has also become a tool for cyber criminals to dupe many.
To tackle the problem of youths getting robbed in such forums, the Shillong Police has been conducting awareness programmes with special focus on girls in schools and colleges.
Police have registered a number of  cases in which miscreants befriended girls and later duped them.
“To deal with the problem police are conducting awareness programmes in schools and college with special focus on girls since most of the victims were females,” sources said.
The cyber frauds target women who are active on the social networking site Facebook.
The criminals first create a fake Facebook account and befriend women users following which they acquire their personal details like date of birth etc.
Later, the fraud informs the victim that he would be sending gifts in a parcel including some foreign currency.
Usually around three days later, the targeted victim receives a phone call from an unknown person who identifies himself as a Customs official and informs that the supposed parcel sent by the Facebook friend has been confiscated. The victim is then asked to pay a hefty fine or face arrest.
Fearing the worst, the victim immediately deposits the money sought for as fine in a bank account provided by the caller without verifying the same from either the Customs department or the Police."

While site for the new Assembly building has been identified at New Shillong Township,  there is no word on when the construction will begin.
After considering several sites in the city for the construction of the Assembly building, the State government had zeroed in on the NST at Mawdiangdiang in order to avoid further congestion in Shillong

11,Ramkrishna Mission receives Rs 30 lakh demand note,"Sunday, August 23, 2015","TURA: After lying low for a few weeks due to intensive operations by West Garo Hills police which led to the arrest of several anti-social elements and busting of their racket, criminal gangs are once again raising their ugly heads.
Unidentified men handed over a demand note of Rs 30 lakh to the Ramkrishna Mission School and Orphanage at Kuralbanga, which lies on the Assam-Meghalaya border of West Garo Hills district on Thursday evening.
The demand was made in a white sheet of paper which carried the drawing of a gun and also reportedly contained an unused bullet.
“We are investigating the matter and have intensified patrolling to nab the culprits behind the extortion drive. We believe it to be handiwork of criminals,” said police officer-in-charge of Kalapani outpost, which falls on the Assam side of the border.
The Ramkrishna Mission comprises of a school on the Meghalaya side of the border and an orphanage which falls on the Assam border.
Members of Ramkrishna mission have been running the institution for several decades providing free schooling and hostel for a large number of orphans who have no one to turn to.
The institution is run on contributions from devotees, well-wishers and the generous public and is renowned for its humanitarian services for the weaker sections of society.
This is the second time in recent months that criminal gangs have targeted the mission.Early this year, a criminal gang barged into the house of retired Don Bosco school teacher Gaganendra Sanyal at Kuralbanga and took him away at gunpoint.
The criminal gang released the well known scouts and guides teacher of Tura only after receiving a ransom amount.
West Garo Hills police shot and killed one of the gang members and unraveled the identity of the perpetrators within days of the release of Sanyal."
12,CM to hold meet on ANVC pact progress,"Sunday, August 23, 2015","SHILLONG: Chief Minister Mukul Sangma has convened a meeting with the leaders of ANVC, ANVC-B on August 27 to discuss the progress of the Agreed Text of Settlement.
It was on September 24 last year that a settlement was arrived at between the state and the central governments and the ANVC,ANVC-B groups.
Almost after a year, proper rehabilitation package for ANVC-ANVC-B has been pending.
An analysis of the  agreement shows that it does not specify the onetime financial package to the cadres though  the ANVC and ANVC-B cadres are entitled to get Rs.2.5 lakh each as per the norm of the Centre as one time financial assistance which will have to be utilized for livelihood initiatives.
The  Agreed Text for Settlement has no  mention about any special economic package different from the financial assistance of several crores of rupees announced by the Centre for  Bodoland Territorial Council  areas, Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council and  Dima Hasao Autonomous Territorial Council  for the next five years.
Earlier, the Meghalaya Government had planned to provide one time funding support for five years to strengthen the local/ traditional institutions at the grass root level as per the agreement, but there was no follow up action in this regard
In addition, the State Government had also written to the Centre on whether to continue with providing monthly stipend of Rs 3,000 each to the rehabilitated ANVC-ANVC-B cadres since the militant outfit was disbanded in December last.
However, the State Government is yet to receive any reply from the Centre.The features of the tripartite pact signed on September 24 in the presence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and the Chief Minister  include  increasing the numbers of members to Garo Hills Autonomous District Council from 30 to 40, and giving tribal council additional powers in administration and organization within its jurisdictio"
13,Women police in Meghalaya free from gender bias,"Sunday, August 23, 2015","New Delhi: Women in police forces recruited for safety of women in India are not only very less in number but also face chauvinism, but in matrilineal Meghalaya the case is different, an international report said.  Despite the central government’s call for the force to raise the proportion of women to 33  percent, women make up only 6.11 percent of India’s 2.3 million police, a report by the  Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative found.
The study was done in four states in the  country form different regions- Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Kerala, Rajasthan and Haryana.
Of the states covered, the male culture is less acute in the Meghalaya Police, the report said. “As Meghalaya is a matrilineal society, there is greater space for women’s participation in the overall workforce,” it added.
While representation of women in Meghalaya Police is only 2.87%, the women  police interviewed did not complain of discrimination or other attitudinal cultural problems,  the report said. But in case of other states women complained about menial duties, bypassed for promotion  and sexual harassment by male colleagues.
Interviews with male and female police officers in five Indian states found that women face a  deep-seated gender bias across the police force, which starts at recruitment and continues  throughout their career, said Devika Prasad, co-author of the report “Rough Roads to Equality:  Women Police in South Asia”.
“Everywhere that we went, women police across ranks told us one of the most discouraging  things for them is that there are no women on recruitment and interview boards and selection  panels,” Prasad said at the launch of the report.
“We also found that women are assigned desk and clerical jobs and not given frontline  operational duties such as investigations.
We were constantly told by male police that  policing is a man’s job and that women can’t do the job as they are not strong physically and  psychologically.”
As a result, women are concentrated in the lower ranks of the police and made to work on  specific ‘women and child’ crimes where they record statements and register complaints, but  gain little experience, reducing their chances of promotion.
The study showed that more than 80 percent of policewomen are constables, the lowest rank, 7.8  percent head constables, 3.35 percent assistant sub inspectors and only 0.02 percent hold the  top ranks – director general and additional director general.
The report also found that there was little acknowledgment by the police leadership of sexual  harassment. Many policewomen did not even know there was a law against sexual harassment in  the workplace, and how and where to complain.
“There is a real fear that they will be maligned, punished and victimised. We found that they  would not speak to us formally, but during breaks they would tell us sexual harassment is  endemic,” said Prasad.
There were many cases where police women on duty would avoid even drinking water since there are no separate toilets for them, the report said. Despite Government order, many police stations do not have separate toilets for women, it added."
14,JACATAM forms RTI group to examine cess deduction,"Sunday, August 23, 2015","SHILLONG: The JACATAM has constituted an RTI group headed by Kular Khongjirem as the convener and R Ronghang as the chairman to examine the possibilities of filing an RTI on the deduction of cess for upliftment of the education sector in the state.
“We have formed the RTI group to know the areas on which we can file an RTI to find out about the cess deduction implemented by the State Government which is meant for the betterment of the education sector,” JACATAM chairman ED Nongsiang told newsmen after the general meeting of the association here on Saturday.
He said that the other reason for finding out the deduction on cess is that they were told by chief minister Dr Mukul Sangma in their last meeting on July 29, that the Government has not been able to fulfill their demand on the proposed provincialisation of the service of the teachers in the State since it does not have the resources at the moment.
“The chief minister assured us that the provincialisation of service of teachers will be done as and when the funds are available with the Government,” the chairman said.
It may be mentioned that the State Government had planned to utilise the funds collected through the cess from cement in funding various social sectors like sports and education. Also, the Government had decided to introduce a cess on clinker at Rs 20 per metric tonne for the purpose of empowering the education sector.
When asked about the status of their demand, Nongsiang said that the Government has accepted the comparative study report submitted by the Directorate of School Education and Literacy (DSEL) to the State Government on the provincialisation of the service of teachers.
He said that the directorate has given the details about the comparative studies where a delegation from the Education department led by the director had gone to various States like Kerala, Goa, Assam and Sikkim to conduct a comparative study on the feasibility of this proposed exercise.
Giving out some of the details of findings of the comparative study, Nongsiang said that the Education delegation team has found that there are three categories of schools in Kerala and Goa- Government, Provincialised and Self Financing Schools.
“In Kerala, the State Government has provincia-lised all the schools which were set up before 1991,” JACATAM chairman said.
Informing about the findings of the Education team in Assam, he said that the Assam Government had decided to provincialise all the schools in 2011, adding that presently there are three categories of schools in Assam as well.
”After the provincialisation of schools, now there are only about 10 percent       of private run schools in Assam,” Nongsiang said.
Meanwhile, he said that the situation in Sikkim is a bit different since it is yet to have its own board.“All the schools in Sikkim are affiliated either to the CBSE or ICSE,” he said even as informing that the provincialisation of the services of teachers is yet to take place in Sikkim.
JACATAM said that they are happy as the findings of the comparative report of the DSEL coincide with their demand to provincialise the services of the teachers.
“It now depends on the political will of the Government to provincialise the service of teachers,” Nongsiang said.
JACATAM chairman said that the total expenditure on salaries will be around Rs 900 cr annually.
“Presently, the Government spends around Rs 500 crore on the salaries of the teachers. The Government will incur an extra expenditure of another Rs 400 crore once it provincialised the service of the teachers,” he said.
Nongsiang said that currently, there are around 1200 schools in the State under deficit pattern and the number of deficit and adhoc teachers in state totals to 37,000.
Meanwhile, he informed that as a part of the proposed provincialisation, the Government has managed to keep its commitment of releasing the salaries every month.
According to him, the teachers used to receive the salaries once in three months. “We are happy that we are receiving our salaries regularly,” JACATAM chairman added.With the assurance on the part of the chief minister, he said that they have decided to take part in this year’s ‘Teacher’s Day’ celebration organised by the State Government."

22,NE should have trade ties with neighbours: Rijiju,"Saturday, August 22, 2015","SHILLONG: Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, on Friday stressed on the need for North Eastern states to open up their trade activities with the neighbouring countries.
Speaking at the Cooperative Summit organized by National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) for the Development of Cooperatives in North Eastern Region here on Friday, Rijiju said that 98 per cent of the region is connected with the neighboring countries and only 2 per cent is connected through the Siliguri corridor with mainland India and it was for this reason that the region should have trade relations with the neighbouring countries.
Stressing that the states should have ports for trade and commerce with the neighbouring countries, he said he would study the reports of the Summit and take corrective measures to take the cooperative movement forward across the country.
Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Cooperation, Mohanbhai Kalaynjibhai Kundaria while speaking at the summit, said that the NCDC has an in-depth understanding on the responsibilities of cooperatives in ensuring inclusive growth and socio-economic development in the lives of small and marginal farmers, rural artisans, rural women and weaker sections of society.
Stating that the NCDC has included programmes such as Tourism, Hospitality, Transportation, Electricity and Energy, Rural Housing, Hospital, Health Care and Education within its fold so that all round development of the country could be ensured, he said that the Agriculture Ministry was giving special attention for agriculture development in North Eastern states considering the huge potential for development of cooperatives  in the region.
He hoped that the summit will come out with a concrete and implementable action plan for development of cooperatives in the North East and assured continuous and committed support of the Government of India, particularly the Agriculture Ministry in all such endeavours.
Chief Minister Mukul Sangma observed that the momentum of cooperative movement in the State has died down over the years; therefore having such summits will enable in depth understanding of complexities faced by the cooperative societies that is also related to the unique challenges that the North East region face.
He informed that in Meghalaya there was a need to infuse new enthusiasm amongst people that cooperatives can be another instrument to create sustainable livelihood, and with this view the Meghalaya Livelihood and Access to Market Projects (LAMP) was designed to create a cluster of cooperative societies by integrating a number of villages to ensure that cooperatives become agencies to create the market linkages for farmers who are being supported with various livelihood options which are on a sustainable basis.
The chief minister also highlighted a problem of cooperatives not being able to integrate themselves because of lack of support resulting in dislocation of marketing strategy of their cooperative products. “Connectivity through all weather roads, infrastructure and collection centres in a hub and spoke model for ensuring market access is a challenge,” he added.
Cooperation Minister H.D.R. Lyngdoh stressed the importance of setting up a Centre of Cooperative Excellence and Skill at Shillong with Central Government assistance in fulfilling the potential of the State and the North Eastern region in this sector."

39,It’s a bugs’ world for night bus passengers in Garo Hills!,"Saturday, August 22, 2015","TURA: Passengers preparing to board night buses for travel from Tura to Guwahati and Shillong are being given an advisory by ‘victims’ to either go at one’s peril or be prepared for a night of ordeal.
Besides the high cost of travel on dilapidated buses which lack basic amenities and a bumpy road, the latest nightmare to face night travelers are bed-bug infestation on the seats that have been keeping passenger awake for most part of the night and leaving behind itchy welts on their skin.
Cimex lectularius or the bed-bug is believed to be the culprit behind the cause of skin rashes among countless number of passengers who have availed the night service at one point of time or the other.
The issue of bed-bug infestation on passenger buses originating from Tura has been raging for months with many lodging verbal complaints to bus conductors and drivers about bites and rashes. But little or no action has been taken by transport operators to eradicate this menace.
Affected passengers have now taken to social media website Facebook to highlight the issue sharing their experience (read plight) at the hands of these obligatory hematophagous (bloodsucking) insects.
While some victims have displaced the rashes suffered after a night of travel on some of these bug-infested buses, one young traveller went a step further and clicked a photo on his mobile while the bugs were gorging on his blood.
He has now uploaded the picture on FB to highlight the problem.
Hundreds of passengers, particularly young boys and girls studying in Guwahati and Shillong, use the night bus service so as to be able to reach their destination early morning.
Transport operators charge Rs.350 a ticket from Tura to Shillong, while the price for Guwahati is Rs.250 per passenger.
Despite the high charge there appears to be no cleaning service of the interiors leaving passengers at the mercy of the nocturnal insects."
40,Is Wahumkhrah encroachment responsible for city flood?,"Friday, August 21, 2015","Call for coordinated efforts to control flooding
SHILLONG: Yet again heavy rains have resulted in the flooding of low lying areas of the city much to the dismay of the authorities who are now calling for a coordinated effort on the part of the concerned departments to deal with the situation in future.
Additional Chief Secretary in-charge Urban and Municipal Affairs, P. Naik said on Thursday that there is an urgent need to prevent encroachment on PWD roads in parts of city. The encroachment, he said, results in blocking the drainage system which ultimately leads to flooding.
Naik added that congestion due to encroachment on PWD roads also raises the risk of accidents.
Though the East Khasi Hills district administration indicated that the flooding was not mainly due to the overflow of Wahumkhrah River, Naik said, “If Wahumkhrah does not have free flow due to choking, the spillover effect is the flooding of adjacent areas.”
The water level of the river is on the rise due to siltation, he added.
The official also pointed out that the Water Resources department had submitted a plan earlier for flood control in Wahumkhrah.
While heavy rains have again led to flooding of the Wahumkhrah, which is afflicted by encroachment, it is evident that the intervention of the National Green Tribunal in the issue has had little impact on the situation thanks to the slow pace of follow up action on the part of the State Government on the encroachment issue.
The NGT Special Circuit Bench, Eastern Zone had on January 29 directed the Meghalaya Urban Development Authority (MUDA) to demolish all unauthorized constructions along the banks of Wahumkhrah and Umshyrpi rivers in accordance with the provisions of law within three months.
When contacted, Urban Affairs Minister Ampareen Lyngdoh said some residents have appealed before the court against the order. The process of removal of illegal structures is on, she added.
Stating that residents have filed their response before the Government, Lyngdoh said that the Government is verifying their submissions.
It may be mentioned that the MUDA has received as many as 200 responses from people residing along the banks of Wahumkhrah following the NGT order for removal of illegal structures along the river.
Naik assured that action will be taken against the illegal settlers at Wahumkhrah.
It may be mentioned that environmentalist Naba Bhattacharjee had filed the petition before the NGT seeking its intervention to save Wahumkhrah and Umshyrpi from further pollution.
When contacted, Bhattacharjee said that there is no point in cleaning one portion of the river as it has to be cleaned right from its sources.
In the last hearing in Kolkata, the NGT had directed Shillong Pollution Control Board (SPCB) to submit a detailed action taken report along with status report on actual ground initiatives to improve and solve the solid waste and sewerage issues afflicting Shillong and consequently the rivers namely Wahumkhrah and Umshyrpi and Umiam lake."

SHILLONG: The KHADC on Thursday passed the special rules aimed at empowering the tribal chiefs and traditional institutions whose powers were clipped by Meghalaya High Court last year.
The KHAD (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Rules, 2015 was passed at a special session of the Council.
Interestingly, none of the MDCs from HSPDP and UDP was present when the House passed it.
“We have approved and passed the rules with the intention to have a clear definition on powers and functions of the headmen, the executive members and the dorbar shnongs (village councils),” the KHADC chief P N Syiem told reporters after the session.
He said the rules were framed as per the Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959 which had been pending. The approval of the rules under the 1959 Act was approved in view of last year’s High Court ruling, which has stripped off the powers and functions of the tribal chiefs (village headmen) barring them from issuing any kind of certificates.
The rules would come into force once it is notified in the Meghalaya Gazette, Syiem said adding his executive committee was on the job to speed up the process.
“This will now pave way for the Rangbah Shnong to exercise ( their powers in authenticating birth/death certificates, residential certificates and other day to day disposal,” he said.
Besides the duties, the rules have also defined the qualifications and term of office of the Rangbah Shnong, executive members and the Dorbar Shnong (village council).
Syiem informed that out of the 54 Himas within the jurisdiction of the Council, only 24 have framed their own rules.
The KHADC CEM said that they have formulated these rules as per rule 36 (21) Khasi-Jaintia Hills Autonomous District (Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen) Act, 1959, which stated subject to the approval of the district council, the executive committee may make rules for carrying out the purposes of this Act.
According to him, once the rules are passed by the KHADC then it would be applicable to all the Himas who were yet to formulate their own rules.
Interestingly, the KHADC has also taken the initiative to streamline the role of the traditional institutions in term of sale or purchase of land within their respective jurisdiction."

SHILLONG: KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem has slammed a section of the MDCs of the Council for raising issues that go beyond the ambit of the Council and was detrimental to its interest.
Slamming Independent MDC Latiplang Kharkongor and HSPDP MDCs Teilinia Thangkhiew and Pyniaid Sing Syiem, the KHADC CEM said, “The people of their respective constituencies have elected them to speak on issues which concern the interest of the Council. I am surprised that they are speaking in favour of MUDA which is an agency of the Government.”
Syiem’s reaction came after the three MDCs boycotted the special session of the Council convened on Thursday.
He said he had anticipated that the three MDCs would come forward to join the efforts of the KHADC Executive Committee (EC) to legislate its own laws to address the grievances by the people residing in the scheduled areas.
“Many people have raised objections on the implementation of the MUDA building bye-laws outside the municipal areas. We have come up with the laws to meet the expectations and aspirations of the people,” the KHADC CEM said.
He further observed that chapter 1 preliminary of the Meghalaya Town and Country Planning Act, 1973, clearly states that the building bye-laws will be applicable in the scheduled areas only after receiving the consent of the Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
“Therefore, there is no confusion that the MUDA bye-laws    cannot be implemented in the scheduled areas,” Syiem said.
Questioning their stand in speaking in favour of MUDA, the CEM said he was not sure whether it was their error of judgment or whether they had forgotten that they were MDCs whose priority was to protect the interest of the Council.
It may be mentioned that despite opposing the ‘encroachment by MUDA’ into areas outside Shillong Municipal, HSPDP leader Ardent Basaiawmoit and his group, held a meeting with the State Government on August 6 and later welcomed the MUDA Building Bye-laws to be implemented throughout the State to ensure safety of buildings.
Laban MDC Sanbor Shullai had criticized the Nongkrem MLA for taking a u-turn on the issue even though he had initially demanded the withdrawal of the notification of MUDA to implement its bye-laws in the Sixth Scheduled areas."

90,125th death anniv of Catholic missionary to be observed,"Wednesday, August 19, 2015","Shillong: The Shillong Archdiocese has drawn up solemnly befitting programme to observe the 125th death anniversary of the first mission superior of the Society of the Divine Saviour (SDS), Fr. Otto Hopfenmueller, who, in 1890, headed the SDS from Germany who first brought the Catholic faith to North East India, then known as the Mission of Assam.
It may be mentioned that Fr. Hopfenmueller, as Mission Superior, was the leader of a group of four Catholic missionaries, which included himself, another fellow priest Fr. Angelus Muenzloher and two brothers Br. Markanus Schumm and Br. Joseph Baechle of the SDS widely known as the Salvatorians, who first came to plant the seeds of the Catholic religion in N-E India.
Though lacking in numbers and resources the group made up for this shortfall by its more than abundant reservoir of drive and burning zeal to introduce and spread the faith in a land and culture which was     as alien to them as any other remote third world country in the twilight of the 19th Century.
With his relentless labour and leadership quality of head and heart, the fruits of his work of love did not take long to bear fruit for, as early as the end of May, 1890, only three months after arriving to work among the Khasis, the results had become visible when all the material for printing was ready.
On August 4, 1890 he reported to the Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda Fide in Rome that the Khasi catechism, a book in questions and answers summarizing the basic principles of Christianity, was already under print at the Jesuit press in Calcutta.
He also set himself in translating Schuster’s Bible History. By the middle of August he had completed the Old Testament. During this time his translations of the Life of Christ and of the Blessed Virgin Mary were almost ready.
The blistering pace of the Herculean task he undertook and the fact that he regularly did penance and fasted as a means of mortification, eventually took a heavy toll on Fr. Hopfenmueller’s health.

108,World’s largest butterfly comes calling on M’laya,"Tuesday, August 18, 2015","Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing spotted in Ri Bhoi
SHILLONG: The State recently got a surprise visitor in the form of Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing, the world’s largest butterfly, which was spotted in a tiny hamlet in Umroi in Ri Bhoi District.
Found exclusively in the forests of Oro Province in eastern Papua New Guinea, this magnificent butterfly, which is also an endangered species, was spotted by a young man from Umbsien village in Umroi, Mon Mawrie, not once but twice.
Speaking to The Shillong Times, Mawrie said he discovered the butterfly first in the month of May and saw it again on August 15.
Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae) is the largest butterfly in the world with females reaching wingspans slightly in excess of one foot.
“We got electricity connection in our house recently and I think the butterflies were probably attracted by the lights,” Mawrie said while substantiating his claims with photos and videos of the butterfly that he had captured.
According to him, the finding would be a great boon since this type of butterfly is rarely found in other parts of the world.
Mawrie said that he had also approached the State Forest department over the finding but there was hardly any response.
It may be mentioned that the Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing lays eggs on the poisonous leaves of a tropical pine-vine and the butterfly is smuggled for an amount of over $8500.
Mawrie recently also found the skin of a snake in the village forest and approached the Forest Officer with a request to preserve it. The DFO, however, rejected the idea saying that the department did not have the necessary medicines to preserve it."

Citizens, both young and old, and men and women, enjoyed the programmes lined up for the day at Polo Grounds and at Khyndailad.
The crowd at Khyndailad was phenomenal although the attendance at the official function at Polo Grounds was less than impressive.
After almost two decades, Shillongites celebrated Independence Day without the customary bandh call that had come to be the order of the day. Though business houses kept their shutters down in the main commercial areas of the city, traffic movement was quite normal on Saturday.
“This is probably the first time that I am seeing this kind of celebrations in Shillong and all the credit for this goes to the High Court of Meghalaya,” said a jubilant youth who had come to Khyndailad to partake in the celebrations.
Some citizens observed that it would take another 2-3 years for the situation to become completely normal.

119,Twin attacks on Aug 15 marks GNLA stir,"Monday, August 17, 2015","TURA: Attack on a police patrol team in Dobu area and burning of a bike and assault on a policeman in Resubelpara region were two incidents perpetrated by banned GNLA on the morning of August 15 while Garo Hills was celebrating the country’s 69th Independence Day.
A group of GNLA militants targeted a police commando team from Dobu outpost which had been on operational duty at a school in the nearby village of Dobu Achakpek, 1.5 km away.
The militants opened fire from a distant hillock at the police team that had been positioned in the area for prevention of possible ambush by ultras.
The bullets hit the walls and windows of the village school but did not find any casualty as the police team took up positions and returned fire forcing the ultras to flee from their ambush site.
The security force personnel of Dobu police outpost, 20 km from Williamnagar, were unfurling the Tricolour and taking salute at around 7 am when they heard gunshots in the direction of their patrol party out on duty.
Reinforcements were rushed to Achakpek village by which time the militants had fled. A search of the area revealed that the militants had fired from a distance of around 500-600 meters after taking position atop a nearby hill.
“We have recovered some empty ammunition cases and also some live rounds from the ambush site. There were around seven militants. Our operational teams are still combing the area,” informed district police chief Davis Nestell R Marak.
Police have identified the GNLA team that attacked them to be that of former Chokpot commander Pangkam who is now leading a group under the direct command of GNLA chief Sohan D Shira.
On the same morning and close to the same hour, a Meghalaya police battalion constable who was heading for his official duties was stopped by another group of GNLA militants and severely assaulted in North Garo Hills District.
Constable Bijoy Momin (35) had just left his home at Kantolgre village, 8 km from district headquarters Resubelpara, on a motorcycle when an eight-member GNLA team halted his two wheeler at Rongkamcheng village.
Unaware of his police identity and presuming him to be a member of the public, the militants began to assault him with rifle butts and sticks for venturing out during the agitation. They also set on fire his motorcycle.
As the assault was taking place, villagers rushed out to see what was happening but the militants fired a few rounds in the air to frighten them. The militants soon disappeared in the jungles leaving behind the severely injured constable.
The militants reportedly made attempts at ambushing security force personnel in the militancy infested south Garo Hills district also.

SP (City) Vivek Syiem informed that ANTF received an input on August 14 about a heroin supplier operating from Laitumkhrah. One person identified as Kaster Jassa (29), a suspected buyer from Laitumkhrah Bazar was followed and apprehended. This led to the confirmation of the peddler identified as Inderjit Singh (40) of Lamsang Imphal, Manipur.

121,Gallantry awards to cop under ‘scanner’,"Monday, August 17, 2015","SHILLONG: Questions are being raised on the twin gallantry awards to Deputy Superintendent of Police T.C. Chacko who was alleged to have been involved in the fake encounter killing of Washington N Marak, a 60-year-old villager, when he was the circle inspector of Williamnagar, more than five years ago.
The police team was led by Chacko during the encounter and Washington was branded as a GNLA cadre.
Chacko is the recipient of this year’s President’s Police Medal for Gallantry (PPMG) and Police Medal for Gallantry (PMG). The announcement  was made by the President of India on August 14.
After criticism from various quarters, earlier in May 2012, the National Human Rights Commission after proper inquiry had directed the State Government to pay Rs.3 lakh to next of kin of Washington who was killed during the police encounter at Rongkrekgre village near Williamnagar across the Simsang River under East Garo Hills on January 26, 2011.
Sources said on Sunday that the matter had even figured during the Assembly session in June last year with NPP legislator James Sangma questioning the promotion of T.C. Chacko.
The Government had promoted the officer from the rank of Circle Inspector to the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police which had irked the legislator then.
Moreover, sources added that earlier in March last year, the police officer was transferred from a field posting to police headquarters here following allegations of his involvement in the coal trade.
Though he was appointed as DSP in charge Anti- Corruption Branch here, he was deputed for anti-insurgency operations.
Earlier, the United A’chik Liberation Army (UALA), a breakaway group of ANVC-B had alleged that with the support of the Government and police higher ups, Chacko had handed over two AK-56 and one AK-47 rifles to ANVC-B leader Rimpu Marak when he was part of the parent ANVC to arm the group to take on other militant outfits, especially the GNLA.
UALA’s self-styled commander-in-chief Singbirth Marak alias Norrok X Momin, who made the allegation in May, 2013, had also claimed that he had been a witness to the handing over of the arms.
An official source said that though the Government had ordered a magisterial inquiry headed by the then Additional District Magistrate M.K. Marak from East Garo Hills to probe the allegation, the inquiry was aborted mid way since the magistrate did not get any response from the police officer and moreover, he had demanded that another magistrate should head the probe panel.
However, after Marak was transferred to Shillong, the East Garo Hills district administration had sent a preliminary report to the Political department on September 13, 2013, but in vain as the department did not follow up the matter, sources added.
Chacko was not available for comments. When contacted to get the response regarding the allegations against the police officer, a senior Government official said that he has to go through the records."

JOWAI: The affected teachers of the infamous education scam have accused the State Government of being non-responsive to the stay order issued by the Apex court of India against the termination of 246 lower primary school teachers in 2014.
According to the chairman of the aggrieved teachers, Shiva E Siangshai, the Supreme Court order dated April 21, 2014 with regard to Emkupar S Syiem versus the state of Meghalaya and others, stayed the High Court Order dated August 16, 2012.
“The State Government seems to be non-responsive to the one-and-half-year old stay order of the Apex Court against the termination of 246 LP School Teachers in 2014 in the infamous education scam appointed during the tenure of the then minister of Education, Ampareen Lyngdoh, as recommended by the High Level Scrutiny Committee (HLSC) constituted by Education Department as per directives issued by the Meghalaya High Court Division Bench in 2013,” Siangshai said. Siangshai informed that after hearing the Special Leave Petition (SLP) filed by Emkupar S Syiem, East Khasi Hills, and others versus the State of Meghalaya, the Supreme Court had unanimously stayed the High Court Order. However, the State Government “has violated the stay order for more than 18 months”.
He also informed that a group of affected teachers from Jowai have informed that an SLP has been filed with the Supreme Court and is being awaited.
Interestingly, the State Government has filed a counter affidavit denying the truth that members of the HLSC were not officials of the Education Department.
He further stated that the reaction of State Government might be termed as a contempt of court as no response has been made to the Court’s order and to reinstate the services of those terminated teachers of all five Sadar divisions.
“We are waiting for justice and our services to be reinstated as per Court’s order. The teachers were made scapegoats as they were qualified for the job and knew nothing about the anomalies and the back door recruitment policy of some politicians with vested interests,” Siangshai added."

Stating that Laloo was a member of the party holding the post of general secretary (administration) during 2009-2013, the BJP said that during his tenure he not only remained away from his responsibilities but failed to acquire the ideology of the party.
“This forced the then State president (BJP) to remove him from his position,” the BJP said.
The party also clarified that the present party president, Khlur Sing Lyngdoh was not nominated by the former president, H.S Syiemlieh but by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
In a statement issued by Delina Khongdup, the State Secretary, Meghalaya BJP said that Laloo had not only remained away from his responsibilities during his tenure but failed to acquire the ideology of the party.  Laloo had contested  in the   ( Assembly election from then Laitumkhrah constituency in the year 1998 unsuccessfully with the support of BJP but he even failed to organize the party in his own constituency thereafter, the BJP alleged.
“Since his detachment with the party, he neither visited the party office nor renewed his membership thus the state BJP has not retained any link with him”, Khongdup said
According to State BJP, an ad-hoc committee can run the day-to-day affairs of the party in the state as per its constitution until an elected body is formed.
The present National President, Amit Shah who held meetings with all the members, party workers and supporters on April 22 this year at Convention Center here visited the state not for election campaign but to have interaction with leaders of different political parties and religious leaders as well as party workers, the state BJP said, adding that this was organized successfully."

132,GNLA stir leads to total closure,"Saturday, August 15, 2015","Security forces stage flag march in Garo Hills
TURA: The entire western belt of Meghalaya comprising five Garo Hills districts witnessed total disruption of normal life due to an agitation by the banned GNLA outfit which used the services of social media and cellular networks to spread its message across.
Following a High Court order banning the publication of bandhs by media houses and newspapers, the militant outfit has switched to the use of social media to spread its agenda.
While no untoward incident was reported from any part of the region, security forces remained on high alert on the eve of Independence Day celebrations.
On Friday, all major towns and district headquarters in the Garo Hills, including Tura, Williamnagar, Baghmara, Resubelpara and Ampati wore a deserted look with shops, banks and educational institutions closed, vehicular traffic off the road and people remaining indoors.
Almost all government offices were under lock and key as employees failed to turn up for their duties except for the offices of the deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police.
The plain belt region of West Garo Hills, which had previously been unaffected by  agitations was, this time, closed. Barring a few small shops that opened up for business, normal life came to a grinding halt in the towns of Phulbari, Rajabala, Tikrikilla, Garobadha and Mahendraganj.
Official sources reveal that suspected militants and their sympathisers allegedly used messaging services and phone calls to create maximum impact of its agenda.
To instill confidence and as part of its area dominance operation, the Tura police along with the CRPF undertook a flag march on Friday afternoon and again in the evening with columns of security force personnel atop police vehicles moving through the different localities of the town sirens blaring.
Special commando units were also out on patrolling in other districts of Garo Hills to prevent any attempt by the militants to create mayhem.
The rumour mills also worked overtime to spread confusion as false reports of incidents flew thick and fast from different parts of the five districts of Garo Hills.
Our Reporter adds: The West Garo Hills district administration will write to the Government to block the social networking sites which are being used to spread hatred and anti-India messages and also those which pose threat to life.
Referring to the facebook postings of GNLA, which resulted in the closure of shops besides paralyzing normal life in Tura and adjoining areas, the West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Pravin Bakshi said that the issue of regulating the social networking sites which are often used to spread hate messages will be taken up with the Government soon."
133,Citizens of K&J Hills to celebrate bandh-free I-Day,"Saturday, August 15, 2015","SHILLONG: Independence Day celebration this time around would be different from the preceding years. This time no bandh has been called by the militant outfit Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) which usually sends its bandh call missive by email for the media to publish. This time the Meghalaya High Court has cautioned the media not to publish news of such bandh calls which in a sense makes the media a publicity agent.
This will be first time in decades when Independence Day will be celebrated in a befitting manner as shops are likely to be kept open and vehicles too will be plying.
Interestingly, except for the educated lot who have been reading the newspapers regarding the High Court ban on calling  bandhs and the publication of such bandh calls by newspapers, most people still do not know that there is no bandh on August  15. However, people have made their own assumptions that there is a bandh on August 14-15.
Those who have kept a tab on this issue feel a sense of victory and are enthusiastic to celebrate the day without any fear.
Mixdalin Iawsai while sharing her thoughts said that she is extremely happy to see that Independence Day will be celebrated unhindered. “Now this is what I call real independence when we can truly celebrate the day in a befitting manner,” she said, adding that on Saturday she will be going to Khyndailad to be a part of the Government event and even go and watch the free movie. She also said that Saturday will be the first time when she will be moving out of her house on August 15.
Former Leader of Opposition, Conrad Sangma said that even in the past people used to celebrate Independence Day despite the bandh but adds that this time such an important day will be celebrated without fear or intimidation.
He said that he would have a flag hoisting ceremony in his New Delhi residence in the morning and later he will watch the Independence Day programme and the Prime Minister’s speech on television.
Activist  Angela Rangad said that the people of Shillong have always celebrated Independence Day despite the bandh but the culture has been such that her child would tell her that he would take out his bicycle when August 15 approaches, presumably because vehicles don’t ply on that day.
She, however, slammed the Government saying that it must ensure that   the Government vehicles ply during the day as because it has often been seen that they are off the road whenever a bandh is called.
Deputy Commissioner, East Khasi Hills, Peter Dkhar who will be presiding over the first bandh-free Independence Day said that  August 15 is a national holiday and it is the prerogative of the shopkeepers whether to open or close their shops, but added that the local taxis are expected to ply on the roads.
Meanwhile, many Government buildings including  the main  Secretariat, High Court of Meghalaya  and  Governor House   have been illuminated on the occasion of Independence Day.  The State Government has also organized a series of programmes to entertain to the public. Rock Concerts, fancy dress competition,  football matches and other   programmes are being organised to celebrate Independence Day     The State Government has made elaborate security arrangements in the city and the state in view of the celebrations."

According to Kharshiing, if the Government was prompt in finding solution to the pending cases against the NGO leaders, the same enthusiasm was not shown by the Government in ameliorating the sufferings of large number of victims of other crimes."

156,"HC notice to acquitted rape accused, others","Friday, August 14, 2015","SHILLONG: The High Court of Meghalaya has issued notices to an acquitted rape accused, Small Phawa, and others to reply to the appeal of the mother of the minor victim allegedly abused by Phawa.
The Judge T.N.K. Singh after hearing the appeal of the mother on Wednesday issued notices to the concerned    parties to reply within a month.
On November 30, 2011, the accused Phawa allegedly raped the school girl staying as his tenant along with her family at Riatsiatsim locality in Jowai.
Later, in February this year, the ad hoc Judge of the fast track court, Jowai, O.P. Lytan, in his order stated that he was convinced that the prosecution had failed to establish or prove the case beyond reasonable doubt which entitled the accused to acquittal.
Surprisingly, Phawa never spent a single day in jail, sources said, adding that the accused had admitted to the crime in the past.
However, aggrieved over the acquittal of the rape accused by the fast track court, the mother of the minor victim had first sought the intervention of Law department and since there was no reply, she approached the Meghalaya State Legal Service Authority to appeal against the order before the High Court of Meghalaya.
As the case was taken up on Wednesday, the Court wanted the accused and others to file affidavits.
Earlier, in a letter addressed to the Member Secretary, Meghalaya State Legal Service Authority, the mother of the victim, Rita Dhar, pleaded that since she was poor, she was unable to appeal against the order of the fast track court in the High Court.
According to the mother, her daughter was still a minor when she was raped by the accused.
The mother claimed that after her minor daughter was raped by Phawa on November 30, 2011, an FIR was registered and charge-sheet was also filed, but after trial, the accused was acquitted.
The mother reiterated that the girl was less than 16 years of age when the crime took place and added the fact was also acknowledged by the Judge of the fast track court.
However, during a press conference in 2012, Phawa had claimed that there was no rape since the act was consensual.
But the stand of the mother was that since the victim was a minor, the question of consent did not arise as sexual intercourse with a minor amounted to rape.
According to the mother, the Judge of the fast track court had failed to appreciate the fact that a minor cannot give consent to sex."

“The contents of the proposed draft bill will not be applicable to the Garo Community and the bill will totally damage the powers and functions of the Nokmas of the AÅ”kinglands of Garos. The chapter 1 of the draft proposed bill constitute a village council and sub village council in each village/urban locality of the State. The members of the village council/ sub-village council will be elected for the period of 3 years in the election. The proposed draft bill says in its para “the members of the village council and sub-village council shall protect, care for and conserve all community land, community forestland and other community assets and resources from privatization and to prevent the alienation of land within the community”. The proposed bill also stated that “the members of the village council/sub-village council shall issue the written residential certificate, No objection Certificate and land holding certificates to register residents of the village”. These sentences are very dangerous to the Garo Community, particularly to the Nokmas of the Garos,” it said in a statement.
The GNC said that as per customs, practises and usages of the Garo Community, Nokmas have always been the inherited head of the AÅ”king and MaÅ”chong or Mahari as well as custodians and guardians of the AÅ”kinglands. Taking all these into account it said that the custody and Guardianship of the AÅ”kinglands cannot be diverted to the members of village Council and sub- village councils as
mentioned in the proposed bill.
“Village Council and sub-village council is popularly practised in areas which non- tribal people dominate, but it is never practised in the Garo Community.  The proposed bill is totally in favour of non- tribal people and totally against the sentiments and practises of the Garos which have never happened before,” the GNC stated. Further, the GNC said that there was no need for establishment of village councils and sub village councils in Garo Hills as village courts constituted by the GHADC was already in existence. It urged the government to review the proposed bill before tabling it in the upcoming Monsoon session and reject it in the interest of people of Garo Hills."

SHILLONG: The High Court of Meghalaya has set aside the order of arrest issued by the Chief Judicial Magistrate against the two sons of CMJ University Chancellor CM Jha, Govind Jha and Gopal Jha who are the trustee members of the University.
Recently, the single bench of the High Court had set aside the dissolution order of CMJ issued by the State Government.
Hearing a criminal petition, the Chief Justice Uma Nath Singh in his order on Wednesday said that there was blatant abuse of process of court on the part of the then Chief Judicial Magistrate B Joshi  in passing the orders dated 04.08.2014 and 08.09.2014 in CID case No.2(4)/2013.
While the order dated 04.08.2014 refers to non-bailable warrants issued against the sons of Jha with a directions to handcuff them, the order dated  08.09.2014 relates to proclaiming them as absconders under Section 82 CrPC. by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate.
The High Court observed that the accused including CM Jha (alleged to be the main accused), have been granted bail and there is no complaint that any of them has misused the liberty so granted. Besides, ND Chullai, senior Government Advocate, made a specific statement that in view of the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed, the petitioners (sons of Jha) were no more required to appear before the Investigating Officer.
“Thus, to secure the ends of justice, these orders cannot be sustained in law and have to be quashed and set aside. Hence, I order accordingly. Consequently, all such proceedings that arise out of the orders 30 dated 04.08.2014 and 08.09.2014 alleged to be pending with the police and before the court shall also not survive any further. Inevitably, these proceedings shall terminate forthwith”, the Court said
The Chief Justice further added that the petitioners, Govind and  Gopal should not be arrested or called for interrogation or subjected to any kind of pressure, harassment and fear of arrest by the police in connection with CID case.
Regarding hurried action taken against the University, the Court said that on 26.04.2013, all of a sudden the Deputy Secretary to the Governor of Meghalaya, sought lots of information, particularly, with regard to the admission of students within 3 days by 29.04.2013 from the Sponsor. However, without waiting for the reply sought by the Deputy Secretary to the Governor, the  Principal Secretary to the Governor directed the Director General of Police, Meghalaya to conduct investigation into the functioning of the University and launch criminal proceedings if investigation revealed commission of criminal offence against the University. After receiving letter from the Principal Secretary to the Governor, the State CID registered the case on the same day (26.04.2013).
Analyzing various aspects related to CMJ University, the High Court made it clear that the checking the cases of mismanagement, maladministration are within the domain of the State Government and not that of the Visitor who is the Governor of Meghalaya.  Section 48 (2) of the Act makes it clear that, “On identification of mismanagement, maladministration, indiscipline, failure in the accomplishment of the objectives of University and economic hardships in the management systems of University, the State Government would issue directions to the management system of the University. If the directions are not followed within such time as may be prescribed, the right to take decision for winding up of the University would vest in the State Government.”
‘Vengeance by Mooshahary’
As per the order, the information sought by the then Governor RS Mooshahary  from the University in regard to the admission of the students within three days and simultaneous issuance of the direction to the police to initiate criminal proceedings without waiting for the applicant to furnish the requisite information can only suggest the presence of element of mala fide intention on his part to unnecessarily harass the applicant. “It can also suggest that the actions of the Governor are inspired; actuated with and driven by political vendetta which compelled him to usurp the authority not intended to be exercised by him by the Legislature when passing the CMJ University Act, 2009″.
According to the Court, on due consideration of rival submissions, it appears that the cause of action leading to filing of an FIR against CMJ functionaries do not seem to be exactly a criminal one.
Under the epicenter of controversy seems to be some kind of grudge in the mind of the then Governor of Meghalaya over establishment and smooth functioning of the CMJ University constituted under the CMJ University Act, 2009. “Such an impression can be gathered from the pleadings of the petition showing unusual conduct on his part in dealing with the matters connected with the affairs of the University and also from the judgment of the single Judge TNK Singh who had set aside the dissolution”.
The High Court further observed that in the instant case, the presumption of innocence of the accused, being the well established principle of criminal jurisprudence has been completely side-lined from the inception “just in order to appease the Governor who had wreaked vengeance and launched criminal proceedings against the CMJ University and the petitioners and their father”.
The additional document filed by CM Jha in the instant criminal petition and the pending criminal petition of 2014 before the High Court  revealed that the rapid rise of the University had become an eye sore for the State Government which has a personal long standing animosity towards Jha ” for his proximity and long association with some other prominent political leaders of Meghalaya. Since those leaders went out of power, the University as well as the Chancellor has been victimized as a blatant display of political vendetta notwithstanding the fact that among all the private Universities in Meghalaya, the CMJ University is the only private University having its own permanent campus on 30 acres of land and more than 2 lakh sq. ft. built up area including modern classrooms, well equipped laboratories and good quality accommodation for residential students”Missing money
The High Court further said that it was noticeable that in the seizure memo, a recovery of Rs.80 lakh has been mentioned “but for the reasons best known to the Investigating Officer, he made an application on 13.6.2014 seeking permission from the Chief Judicial Magistrate to correct the amount from Rs.80 lakh to Rs. 8 lakh. The petitioners have asserted that the Investigating Officer had seized Rs.80 lakh but he made the application to correct it to Rs.8 lakh for the purpose of embezzling the rest of the amount.
“As usual, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, without holding any inquiry and examining the witnesses to the seizure, allowed the application only on the request of the Investigating Officer”, the Court observed. Besides, when the Investigating Officer prayed for issuance of process under Section 82 CrPC against the petitioners despite the fact that neither the summons nor the non-bailable warrants were ever served upon them, the Chief Judicial Magistrate again acted promptly and without examining the provisions of law issued the proclamation only because of the fact that the request had come from the Investigating Officer”."

174,Money deducted to avoid penalty: Kharkrang,"Thursday, August 13, 2015","SHILLONG: East Khasi Hills SP M Kharkrang has said that deduction of Rs 200 from the account of police constables in advance was to avoid penalties and not to make up for the alleged misappropriation of fund.
Reacting to the news item on constables being forced to pay from their pocket to compensate for the loss of Rs 79 lakh handled by late SI Madan Basumatari, the SP said that Rs. 100  is deducted from the salary of all officers and men towards their individual contribution to an insurance scheme titled ‘Meghalaya Police Social Security Scheme’ which was initiated by Police Headquarters, a number of years back.
The amount deducted is credited to the account of each personnel and is paid to the next of kin in case of death for an amount of Rs 1 Lakh.
The amount is to be paid on or before the date 14th of each month, failing which Rs. 5000 is imposed as fine by the Insurance Company from the office of the Superintendent of Police, East Khasi Hills for failing to pay the premium on or before  14th of each month.
However, there have been times when pay is drawn late and the money could not be deposited in time. To avoid such penalties, it was decided that the amount will be drawn in advance for the month. Hence an amount of Rs 200 was deducted in the month of August, 2015 which is Rs. 100- for the month of July, 2015 and Rs. 100 for the month of August, 2015″, the SP added.

208,Purno bats for smaller states,"Wednesday, August 12, 2015","New Delhi: Former Lok Sabha Speaker Purno A Sangma on Tuesday favoured small states to which he said can fulfill the hopes and aspirations of ethnic tribal communities not only in North East but also in other parts of the country.
While addressing a national seminar on “Perspectives and Realization on the Issues of Smaller States in India” he said that there is nothing wrong in having small states which also provides better and has a focused administration.
He said, “Each tribal community in the North East has a different identity, culture and habits. For obvious reasons such distinct community will expect a separate state to specifically look after their interest”.
The NPP supremo a votary of separate Garo Land state went into the past when the states were created on the ground of language spoken. Even today there are some ethnic tribes who speak a different language but still have not got a separate state, he pointed out.
‘I have always stood for smaller states and I would stand by your demands for smaller states,’ Purno said. The seminar was organized by All Bodo Students Union in league with seven other organizations who were demanding smaller states in different regions of India.
While the leaders welcomed the recent Naga peace accord signed by the Centre, they also decided to appeal Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately formulate a policy to address demands for new states.
They would be calling upon Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh to press for their demands.
They said they would be meeting MPs too and convincing them on creation of new states urging them to raise the matter in the Parliament. The speakers in the seminar also have highlighted tried and tested failures of autonomous council arrangement for fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the ethnic communities especially in the north east region of India.
Chandan Mitra, MP and Editor of The Pioneer Magazine, while attending the seminar has said “The issue of North East India is peculiar, it has been engulfed by burning problems such as unabated illegal influx from across the border, which has threaten to swamp the local ethnic communities and has posed a serious threat to their very existence by snatching away, their land, economy, employment etc.
Thus, it calls for an urgent attention from Centre, including creation of smaller states to protect the culture, identity and land of the indigenous communities of the region”.
“While we have realized the dream of creating Telangana, with your utmost support and love, we shall always standby you in your journey of achieving the goal  for Bodoland and other smaller states in the country. You can always trust and count our support inside and outside the parliament” Jitender Reddy, MP and leader of floor from TRS said.
Apart from Sangama, MPs who offered to support the issue of creating new states included BJP’s Chandan Mitra, Bodoland People’s Front MP Biswajit Daimary, Telegana Rastra Samiti Jitendra Reddy and Bisheshwar Reddy. Many former MPs like U.G. Brahma, Mr. Tapir Gao and S.K. Bwisumuthiari also joined the convention and promised to support the issue at different levels.
Prof. M. Kadandaram said, “The movement for creating new states has always been led by the oppressed. The social, economic and cultural exploitation of the elites in big states have been the main reasons for existence of demand for separate state, he said.
The meet ‘Perspective and Realization on the Issues of Smaller States in India’ that was jointly organized by All Bodo Students Union, Kuki Sate Demand Committee, Joint Action Committee for Autonomous State, Peoples’ Joint Action Committee for Bodoland movement, Joint Action Committee for DimarajiMovement, VidharbaConnect, BharatiyaGorkha Parishangh and Indigenous Peoples’ Front of Tripura."

Dr. Rapsang had been serving in the hospital for the past 5 years, and her service termination came after her contract was extended for another one year, which will expired on April next year.

222,NE witnesses an upswing in tourist arrival,"Tuesday, August 11, 2015","NEW DELHI: Despite several pitfalls in the tourism sector, such as the lack of infrastructure, poor connectivity, reports of violence etc., tourist arrivals to North East both foreign and domestic have shown a persistent increasing trend.
Foreign tourist flow to the northeastern states hiked nearly 40 percent in 2014 over the previous year, even as efforts are on to promote the tourism industry.  Minister of State for Tourism Mahesh Sharma said the number of foreign tourist arrivals in the eight northeastern states in 2014 was 118,552 as compared to 84,820 in 2013 — marking it a 39.76 percent increase.
States like Manipur, Tripura and Nagaland have seen a growth of 20%-29% in foreign tourist arrivals while Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland have seen 36%-41% increase in domestic tourists from 2011 to 2012. A slew of initiatives are responsible for tourists favouring the North East. Apart from flight connections and better packages by tour companies, the government has in the last few years lifted protected area permit (PAP) required for Manipur, Nagaland and Mizoram as a pre-condition for foreign tourists.
The increase in tourist arrivals both from home and abroad can be attributed to the lure of the unexplored, coupled with the perception that the region being safe and affordable. There has been a significant change in perception by which the travelers feel the region is safe to travel in.
According to an industry watcher, government-sponsored concessions like leave travel allowance (LTA) for those travelling to the NE has also contributed to the upturn. Government officials are entitled to flight tickets if they travel to the north-east, J&K and Andaman & Nicobar Islands. A tourism ministry official said festivals and events in the NE had gained popularity, attracting foreign and Indian travelers.
The Minister said that the Government has included the northeast in two new tourism schemes that have been launched. Apart from the Northeast Circuit under the ‘Swadesh Darshan’ scheme, two other circuits under the scheme – Buddhist Circuit and Himalayan Circuit – can be linked to the region, he added.
According to the minister, Kamakhya in Guwahati has been identified under the Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (Prasad) scheme.
Sharma said, “As against the required 10 percent budgetary allocation of every central government ministry for the development of the northeastern region, the tourism ministry has been providing more than that in the last three fiscal years”.
In 2014-15, the ministry allocated Rs.144.68 crore (Rs.1.44 billion) from its Rs.1,100-crore budget in 2014-15 or 13.15 percent of the total budget. In 2013-14, it was Rs.149.16 crore out of Rs.980 crore and in 2012-13, it was Rs.113.72 crore out of Rs.950 crore.
This apart, the ministry has undertaken several initiatives for the promotion of tourism in the northeast, Sharma said. These include provision of complimentary space to the NE in India, pavilions set up at major international travel fairs and exhibitions and 100 percent central government financial assistance for organising fairs and festivals in the northeastern states.
“The ministry of tourism, as part of its ongoing activities, annually releases print, electronic, online and outdoor media campaigns in the international and domestic markets, under the Incredible India brand line, to promote various tourism destinations and products of the country, including the lesser known destinations which have tourism potential,” the minister said.
“The ministry of tourism undertakes special campaigns on northeastern region on TV channels to promote tourism in the region.” He said the International Tourism Mart (ITM) is organised annually with the objective of showcasing the largely untapped tourism potential of the northeastern region in the domestic and international markets.
The minister said the North Eastern Council had conducted a study for the identification of tourism circuits in the northeast and the same has been shared with the respective state governments."
223,Mock police drill throws life out of gear,"Tuesday, August 11, 2015","SHILLONG: What was intended to be a necessary precautionary exercise turned out to be an impediment as the Shillong Police on Monday conducted a mock drill at Laitumkhrah Junction creating fear and panic among the residents of the city, patients and attendants at Nazareth Hospital and parents and students of schools located in the vicinity.
The sound of a demo blast at the junction added to the confusion in the minds of the people who feared that a bomb had exploded.
While Shillong Police maintained that the demo blast was carried out by the Special Branch, the latter claimed that it was the work of the bomb disposal squad of the State police to create awareness among the people as part of preparedness.
Panic-stricken residents called up newspaper offices and police stations to verify whether a bomb blast had occurred.
After the exercise, there were expectations that police higher-ups would come out with an official statement on the mock exercise, but there was no communication from the Police department, evoking much criticism.
Earlier, police had cordoned off the Laitumkhrah junction to conduct the mock drill aimed at checking the preparedness of the police in times of eventuality.
A large number of police personnel participated in the safety drills.
East Khasi Hills SP M. Kharkrang said the drill was basically to assess the response of the police, even as he claimed that the response was good and added that there was room for improvement.
However, the noble intention of the police proved to be severely inconvenient for the public as a huge jam resulted since traffic was diverted at several points in and around Laitumkhrah locality.
The public were also offended that the mock drill was conducted without prior notice and that too, at such a busy time of the day."

226,‘Officials claiming inflated salaries’,"Tuesday, August 11, 2015","Defalcation charges against senior officials of Dr. H. Gordon Roberts Hospital
SHILLONG: A group of youths have accused senior officials of Dr. H. Gordon Roberts Hospital of illegally  inflating their own salaries without the consent and approval of the concerned apex body even as they  demanded ouster of the Medical Superintendent and Administrative Officer of the hospital.
Speaking to media persons here on Monday, Ricky Cooper Pathaw and Kitboklang Nongphlang, members of the Church, said they decided to expose the illegal self increment after KJPA authority failed to intervene in the matter.
The youths alleged that Dr. David D Tariang was appointed as the Medical Superintendent on February 21, 2006, while K.T. Rynjah was appointed as the Administrative Officer on April 30, 2009.
As per the letter on March 29, 2011 issued by the KPJA Senior Administrative Secretary Rev. Dr. J.F. Jyrwa, it was informed that the Assembly had decided to enhance the Charge Allowance of the Medical Superintendent from Rs.14,000 to Rs.22,000 while for the Administrative Officer, the payment will be Rs.20,000 with effect from March 2011, the youths claimed, while substantiating their claims with documentary evidences.
They added that on April 4, 2013, Dr. David D. Tariang issued an office order to himself stating that “approval is hereby accorded to the Charge Allowance of Dr. D.D. Tariang, Medical Superintendent, Dr. H. Gordon Roberts Hospital at Rs.65,000 with effect from April 1, 2013. The expenditure is debitable to the head of account ‘salary’.
“In total, Dr. Tariang alone is drawing a salary of up to Rs.1.70 lakh per month,” the youths alleged, adding, “The Administrative Officer is drawing an inflated salary of Rs.30,000 as against the Rs.20, 000 fixed by the KJPA which totals to Rs.50,000 per month.”
Stating that it was a clear cut violation of the rules of the hospital, the youths also alleged that the two senior officials were sanctioning loans for themselves without the approval of the KJPA. They claimed that Dr. Tariang had sanctioned to himself a personal loan of Rs.3 lakh in May 2012 to be recovered in 12 equal installments.
“Interestingly, as per sanction order, it was stated that the expenditure is debitable to the head of account Upkeep A/C,” they stated, while adding that Dr. Tariang sanctioned to himself another loan of Rs.4.75 lakh in December 2012."

KHNAM working president Adelbert Nongrum expressed his party’s strong opposition to MUDA’s encroachment into the jurisdiction of the Council.
“We demand that the State Government should immediately revoke the MUDA notification to expand its jurisdiction outside the municipal areas,” Nongrum said after a meeting of KHNAM leaders with KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem here on Monday.
Nongrum expressed concern over the recent developments and said, “We do not want to be involved in mudslinging. This has exposed the difference of opinion of various political leaders on the same issue. This ongoing mudslinging between the political leaders is not a healthy trend.”
“As elected representatives we should act responsibly and try not to take political mileage from an issue concerning the interests of the common   people,” the KHNAM working president said.
“It is our duty to fight and back up the steps taken by the Executive Committee of the KHADC on the matter. I feel that all the 30 MDCs should be united against this issue,” he said, adding that his party would extend its support to the efforts of the present EC to formulate the KHADC Building Byelaws.
“I am happy to learn the Council has already passed the Executive Order to pave way for the implementation of the building bye laws within the scheduled areas,” he said.
Nongrum also said that despite being in the opposition, the party would continue to support the good initiative taken by the present EC in the future also."

230,"UDP critical of Govt’s handling of GH peace process, mining policy, MUDA Bye-law","Tuesday, August 11, 2015","SHILLONG: UDP working president Bindo M. Lanong on Monday said that the party in the recent meeting held in Garo Hills was critical of the State Government for giving undue importance to one militant group while ignoring others.
“The Garo leaders criticized the partisan role of the State Government for having nexus with one group, giving importance to the same group, and making peace treaty with them, while sidelining other groups. But how will peace return to Garo Hills, if the government ignores other groups?” Lanong questioned.
According to the UDP, the State Government had mishandled the situation from the very beginning instead of adopting a strategy which should have ensured peace and normalcy in Garo Hills.
The party in Garo Hills has also appealed to all the groups to abjure violence.
Mining policy
Lanong said that the party during the meeting in Garo Hills had also come down heavily on the State Government for politicizing the Mines and Mineral Policy, 2012 as the Government failed to implement the same ever since it was enacted.
The comments of the UDP were in the context of move of the Government to do away with the policy.
The Mines and Mineral Policy, 2012 was exhaustedly drafted by the department of Forest and Environment, Meghalaya State Pollution Control Board, Law and Mining and Geology departments for two years finally coming out with the Policy after consulting with the Centre, political parties, district councils and all stake holders and also by covering all areas including social legal and environment related issues, Lanong pointed out.
The policy was prepared when Lanong was the Deputy Chief Minister in charge of Mining in 2012 and he was also the Chairman of the committee constituted to draft the policy.
“The draft was accepted and approved in the cabinet, but now we are hearing that the government is going to replace it,” Lanong said, adding that the party does not understand the need of ‘replacing the policy’.
“Had the Government implemented the policy, much of the problems arising out of the current situation following the mining ban should have been solved,” Lanong said.
The former Deputy Chief Minister asserted that the Government was interested in politicizing the policy instead of implementing it.
MUDA bye laws
The UDP leader said that there should a spirit of sharing power between the State Government and district councils in line with Centre-State relations as far as the issue of implementation of building laws is concerned.
“The urban affairs department especially MUDA made a policy statement that the department had the sole authority for giving permission to construct buildings and houses. The party appreciates the good intention of the department for planning structural houses, but this will not justify illegal transgression of MUDA outside its jurisdiction which includes areas governed by district councils and traditional institutions,” Lanong said.
The UDP leader asserted that the State should maintain the good old relationship with the district councils in line with the cordial relationship existing between union government and the state without any conflict.
Lanong reminded that when the jurisdiction of KHADC was challenged by Pawan Sharma and others in the Court in December 1999, KHADC had approached the Supreme Court which had given the verdict in favour of the Council."

238,"From RTI to Lokayukta, Grievance Redress Cell","Monday, August 10, 2015","SHILLONG: The city based RTI activists who were in the forefront fighting for the implementation of the Act since 2004-05 reiterated the need to go beyond the RTI findings and to establish a Lokayukta in the state.
RTI activist Michael Syiem told The Shillong Times that people have become pessimistic since the findings of RTI do not lead anywhere as there is no punishment to the guilty after exposing scams.
Syiem reminded that after he and others had exposed scam in the beautification of Khyndailad in 2005, there was no action against those involved as the Chief Secretary who is the State Vigilance Commissioner has not done anything on the findings.
“We believe that under bureaucrats, there is no logical conclusions to the inquiries on scams and the formation of Lokayukta is the need of the hour”, he said.
“Lokayukta can take up cases and effect arrest and seizures. There is undue delay in the formation of Lokayukta in the state.  We will have to protest over the delay in forming Lokayukta”, Syiem asserted
Another RTI activist Angela Rangad said that while the RTI has helped enormously in exposing corruption, the absence of an independent institution to prosecute the corrupt has led to an element of cynicism.
“We from TUR have been active in pushing for an effective independent and accountable Lokayukta and through citizens’ efforts we do have semblance of an effective law, but unfortunately till date the institution has not been made functional and rules still not made public which points to the collusion of a corrupt bureaucracy and the political class”, Rangad alleged.
In addition to a Lokayukta, it is also time for citizens to rally for a Grievance Redress Mechanism which will be effective in handling day to day corruption cases."
239,What has ten years of RTI achieved?,"Monday, August 10, 2015","SHILLONG: Ten years ago, Meghalaya was prompt to implement the Right to Information Act, 2005 after a series of protest from sponsors of pro-RTI movement in State, but there is cynicism now over the ultimate result of filing RTI queries as they end up in just providing information to public without resulting in any punitive action against those involved in scams and other mal-practices.
A look at the 10 years of implementation of RTI Act by The Shillong Times reveals that there were more applications from the people over the years, coupled with increase in the disposal of requests, but at the same time rejections of applications and penalties for not providing information were also on the rise.
As per the information provided by the Meghalaya State Information Commission, from 2006 till 2013, there were 6707 requests received from the RTI applicants and 6414 requests were disposed of. The number of rejections was 101. The number of penalty imposed on officials was 34. In 2006, there was no penalty imposed. (see chart in P-10).
The Meghalaya State Information Commission was constituted by the State Government with effect from October 7, 2005. However, the Commission remained non-functional pending appointment of the Chief Information Commissioner who was finally appointed only in February 2006. In the following month, he assumed office.
The first Chief Information Commissioner DP Wahlang recalled that the beginning days were difficult, but later through awareness programmes, people have come forward to file applications.
While the present Commission maintained that there was enthusiasm on the part of the people to file applications in large numbers, the critics of RTI have pointed out that there were many rejections of applications on whimsical grounds by the Public Information Officers and Chief Information Commissioner.
Angela Rangad, RTI activist said that rather than spreading awareness and making the RTI more accessible, the Commission is today mired in bureaucracy that reeks of an attempt to make it difficult for citizens to ask for information.
“Hence it is imperative that there should also be transparency and peoples’ participation in the selection of those in the Information Commission”, she said.
According to Rangad, a decade since the RTI came into being, one cannot deny that it has helped in not only ensuring availability of information but also made citizens participate more effectively in deepening and making more transparent our democracy. “Because of its effectiveness and vast potential to challenge abuses of power, there has always been attempts to subvert the RTI as is currently happening with the Central Government at the moment and closer home it is obvious that the structures meant for furthering the RTI also indulges in subverting and derailing the RTI in Meghalaya”, Rangad said.
When the institution of SIC came about in 2005, it was an effective and people friendly one that upheld the RTI both in letter and spirit, she added.
Anti-corruption crusader Michael Syiem along with others had agitated for long for the implementation of RTI Act.  Syiem said that there is a need to strengthen RTI as transparency is the need of the hour.
A Public Information Officer (PIO), who does not want to be quoted, said that rejections should be minimum with valid ground and PIO should be able to decide by himself on  providing replies to the queries and there should not be any consultation with the higher ups which is against the rule.
Among the major 10 exemptions in section 8 in The Right To Information Act, 2005 is the information related to disclosure of anything which would prejudicially affect the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security, strategic, scientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreign State or anything which leads to incitement of an offence.
Another exemption is the information which would impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders.
However, some PIOs have resorted to rejection of applications blindly banking on the many exemption clauses in section 8 of the Act, a few RTI applicants said.
But the officials with the office of Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) said that there is always room for first and second appeal if the PIOs reject the RTI applications. Moreover, they said that the role of the CIC is to dispose of the applications impartially.
They also defended that there is no harm in appointing bureaucrats in the Commission as they know the rules and regulations. Moreover, they are familiar with the issues which the departments are handling, the officers added."
240,GNLA forms ‘Eagle Hunters’ to attack police,"Monday, August 10, 2015","SHILLONG: The proscribed GNLA has formed a seven-member Special Operation Team known as ‘Eagle Hunters’ to attack police personnel in the state.
In a statement issued to the media on Sunday, the outfit said that the team of Eagle Hunters was specifically formed to carry out attacks on police personnel anytime anywhere. “Our Eagle Hunters team will shoot police personnel dead on the spot no matter how many police personnel are there  at the time of the incident,” the outfit said.
The outfit also denied role in the ambush on Meghalaya police convoy at Nongshram area in West  Khasi Hills border on Saturday morning by stating that  police had made blind allegations accusing  GNLA for the incident.
After collecting information from different sources, it has been confirmed that the attack was undertaken by a combined group of ASAK,AMEF and deserters from the GNLA, UALA and some new members for reasons best known to them, GNLA said.
GNLA also provided the names of those involved in the attack by saying that it has been  confirmed that Reding T Sangma, former GNLA member and the leader of the ASAK group and his team, Timuth D. Sangma, former GNLA cadre also known as Chijong, Oja Arengh, popularly known as the son-in-law of Hemalpa and himself husband of  Hemal from Rongjeng,East Garo Hills, Dakchak Marak alias Wawai/Wisefield, a deserter of UALA and the original resident of Sampalgre, Williamnagar and their groups were behind the attack.
Dakchak Marak ,the deserter of UALA outfit who joined AMEF was the one who blasted bomb at the Williamnagar petrol pump. He was one of the team members who killed nine Rabhas in Assam and he was also the one who blasted bomb at the Virgo cement factory of Ravi Jain at Damas , North Garo Hills in the past, GNLA alleged.
According to the militant outfit, these groups have all combined and pre-planned the attack with the help of some over ground workers and supporters keeping them informed of the movements of the police personnel their exact time, directions and destinations.
” On the other hand it will be interesting to know that the most capable commander of the “Hillstorm Operation” of the police  Mingran T Sangma, former militant is the brother of the ASAK group’s chief Reding T Sangma”, GNLA statement said, adding  Mingran is always in touch with Reding and informs each other of the movements of the police operations and the GNLA. Mingran was also part of Saturday’s ambush group, the outfit said.
” It is now high time for the Meghalaya police department to be more cautious about those informers from their own department to the groups like us about your plans and movements. Police department should identify those who are bringing or sending others to the jaws of death by providing information”, GNLA added."

242,"Building laws flouted due to nepotism, corruption: Jemino","Monday, August 10, 2015","SHILLONG: Nonghtymmai UDP legislator Jemino Mawthoh said that there is no clarity on the part of the Government and District Council on the urgency of streamlining urban administration and management to cater to the growing urbanization and the stress and strain of urban living in terms of civic amenities, congestion, health, safety and security.
“There is a need to have a uniform policy under the provisions of the law for systemic growth of urban centres. Urban centres should be seen as engine of growth and development,” Mawthoh stated in a statement issued here on Sunday.
He observed that there is no denying the fact that there is a need to have an authority to ensure proper enforcement of urban administration and management, to oversee that building codes and building laws are strictly adhered to.
“But the fact remains that MUDA has failed in this respect. Building laws have been flouted due to nepotism and corruption. Transparency and civic engagement is foremost. The tussle between the State and the District council with regard to the issue of jurisdiction needs to be resolved at the earliest so that the common citizens are unnecessarily not harassed,” UDP legislator stated.
Mawthoh further observed     that the State Government should clearly demarcate the areas with urban characteristics and rural characteristics so that schemes meant for the two sectors are properly distributed and implemented.
He also said that urban towns designated as Census town like Nongthymmai, Madanrting, Pynthorumkhrah, Mawlai and Nongmynsong MLA schemes are under Community and Rural Development (CRD) and are not availing urban schemes despite having urban characteristics.
‘It is sad to see that many areas outside Municipal jurisdiction are on the verge of urban collapse,” UDP legislator said.
He also said that there are questions raised about the competency of the District Council in bringing out its own building bye laws.
“Whether the District Council has the wherewithal in terms of expertise, manpower and resources to implement the same,” Mawthoh questioned.
The UDP legislator feels that the District Council and the State should sit together for thorough deliberation on the matter to resolve the legal tangles and keep the interest of the common citizens as priority.
“Interpretation of existing laws appears to be more politicized rather than making an effort to resolve the matter thereby making the issue more complicated. MUDA should immediately withdraw the notification of preventing citizens to avail electricity from MeECL and water connection from PHE as temporary relief to those who have already constructed houses,” he stated.
“Political actors should not play to the gallery and instead provide solutions to ease the problems faced by the public. In a highly politicized environment as evident in heated altercation between the ruling and opposition in the District Council, the friction between legislators of the ruling party, the people and the state as a whole stands to lose. What is most astonishing is that those opposing the encroachment by the MUDA are now head on collision with each other. This is an indication of lack of understanding about resolving the issue,” Mawthoh said.
The UDP legislator further added that the Government, District Council and citizens should take into consideration the potential significance of the pace of change, and the opportunities and risks involved and make efforts for broad based participation."
243,Anomalies in MGNREGS at Pynter,"Monday, August 10, 2015","SHILLONG: There are allegations of anomalies in the implementation of MNREGS in Pynter Village, East Khasi Hills, Civil Society Women’s Organization (CSWO) said in a statement issued here on Sunday.
There are some beneficiaries of MGNREGS in Pynter Village, falling under Block Development Office, Pynursla, who worked for a footpath in the village in 2012-2013 but have been denied of their wages.
Moreover, the villagers were made to sign in the muster rolls of the new work for which the work was not even carried out, the CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing alleged.
“When they refused to sign, they were cautioned by one Jebinstone Nongkrot who is a member of the VEC (Village Employment Council) that they would face hardships in future and were not given any more work after this”, Kharshiing said.
Till date they have not received any payment for the work done by them in 2012-2013. One such beneficiary is Trilian Umsong who had worked for 51 days in March-April 2012 and September 2012 but received payment for only 12 days besides there are also other beneficiaries who are affected.
According to MGNREGA scheme, when a family is allotted 100 days they share or work at the same time  but will cover the 100 days and not more than that. But there are families who have worked for more than 100 days but received payment for only a few days. They are then made to sign on a muster roll which is for another work and made to understand that if they sign on the muster roll then they will get the payment for the old work.
Further in an alleged blatant abuse of power, three members of a family have three job cards for the MGNREGS at Pynter villlage. Kania Khongmawloh, his wife Tlidamai Nongrum, and his son Eliphiles Nongrum who is the secretary of VEC and the village as well, have been working for the construction of a footpath at Pynter Village, Pynursla from October 28, 2013 to November 3, 2013.
In addition there are other work codes which are not mentioned, but three members of the same family are given separate Job Cards and were even given work exceeding the 100 days totaling to 162 days for the year 2012-2013, while others did not even get the 100 days promised to them nor were they paid the for days they worked, CSWO alleged.
The CSWO urged the authorities to take immediate steps to stop such abuse as per law so that illiterate beneficiaries from villages are not taken advantage of, and receive their wages for the work done by them. The CSWO also demanded action against any Government servant who subvert the law and who ignores helping rural villagers in benefiting from the schemes they are entitled to."

The Minister assured to examine the matter during the meeting held on August 6.
During the meeting, Kurkalang had raised the problem of youths of Meghalaya for not getting selection in para-military, central police forces and in military recruitments.
“Though the youths of Meghalaya are qualified and successful in their academics, they are not selected on account of short height, even as they are mentally and physically fit” Kurkalang said.
As per the reports and complaints of local youth who approached BJYM leader, the discrimination happened even in the recruitment of Assam Riffle, Assam Regiment and 58 GTC here in Shillong itself as many youths missed the chance to serve the nation.
In this regard, BJYM submitted a memorandum to Rijiju, and urged him to take necessary steps regarding the matter so that the authority concerned can give height relaxation or any special consideration for the youths of Meghalaya to enable them to join security forces and to serve the nation.
“If chances are given to join military, it will solve to some extent unemployment problem and also prevent the youths from getting involved in illegal activities”, Kurkalang apprised the Minister."

The author’s sixth collection of poetry in English, “Time’s Barter: Haiku and Senryu” has achieved a rare distinction of becoming the first book of haiku poems by an individual author from the Northeast to be published by HarperCollins, one of the most prestigious publishers in the world.
Time’s Barter: Haiku and Senryu was released by the Vice-Chancellor of Martin Luther Christian University R. G. Lyngdoh, who is also a writer in the presence of American Poet and Critic Michael Scharf and Gavett Rumnong, Assistant Professor, Shillong College. The book consists of 280 haiku and senryu (or funny haiku) presented in an elegant gift-sized edition with illustrations. The function was attended by over one hundred invitees and guests which included professors from NEHU and other Colleges, writers, poets, research   scholars, and other eminent personalities of the city.
Two other books by the same author, Ki Kyrwoh: Ki KhanaPhawer and Hiraeth and the Poetry of SosoTham were also released. While Ki Kyrwoh is a collection of amusing and morally significant fables and parables originating in these hills. Hiraeth and the Poetry of SosoTham is a critical study of the poetry of SosoTham with the help of the Welsh literary convention of hiraeth and the unconventional elegiac tradition of European literature.
The haiku is the smallest of the world’s literary forms originating in Japan, where it has been well established since at least the seventeenth century. It normally contains three lines, with 5 syllables in the first line, 7 in the second and 5 in the third. Modern haiku, however, no longer follow the 5-7-5 pattern very strictly and strive instead for brevity, concision, suggestiveness and a profound metaphorical quality through the use of concrete imagery and present-tense immediacy.
This is what the award-winning Welsh writer, poet and critic, (late) Nigel Jenkins, had to say about the book: “This collection of haiku by Kynpham Sing Nongkynrih represents a breakthrough for the haiku not only in the Northeast, where I gather from anthologists of the region’s literature that there are no known haiku practitioners, but also in India as a whole, where there may be little more than half a dozen serious haiku poets”."

Residents said that recently after the complaints were lodged , the PHE started laying pipes which shows that their grievances were genuine and the Government was  delaying to take action for the last several years.

In a statement issued here on Sunday, HPM general secretary Robert June Kharjahrin said that they are going to organize public meetings in several areas of Khasi and Jaiñtia Hills to create awareness among the people at the grass root level on the provisions of the VAB passed by two Autonomous District Councils and the ordinance of the State Government.
According to him, the movement has also proposed to make people aware of the Meghalaya Local Administration (Empowerment of Traditional Institutions, Traditional Bodies and Headmen in Governance and Public Delivery System), Ordinance, 2015.
”We would seek public support to oppose the ordinance and also to demand from the state government for its immediate removal,” Kharjahrin said.
Meanwhile, the HPM, which was recently formedwith the aim to bring unity among the indigenous community, also appealed to all traditional institutions and their heads, youths, women, NGOs and political parties to attend the public meetings.
The public meetings will be held in the different districts of Khasi and Jaintia Hills from August 13 at Mawryngkneng village in East Jaintia Hills to be followed by Umsning and Nongpoh in Ri Bhoi, Markasa and Nongstoin in West Khasi Hills, Smit in East Khasi Hills and Jowai in West Jaintia Hills."

The officer in Charge of Laban police station, B.K. Mishra, informed that Aimonsidora Niangmih, the headmistress of Raid Laban LP School, was arrested after a complaint was lodged against her.
As per the police, the accused had brought a plot of land in 2004 and sold it in 2008. However, she allegedly forged the land documents and again sold the same plot of land to another buyer.
Mishra informed that the accused then applied for a loan of Rs.40 lakh from the State Bank of India Main Branch, which was, incidentally, approved by the bank without proper verification and authentication of the documents.
Suspecting that the accused might have obtained the loan in connivance with some staff, police are likely to question officials of the State Bank of India, Deputy Commissioner’s office and even the KHADC.
The accused was produced in the court and was remanded in five-day police custody but had to be admitted in hospital after she fell sick.
Police are likely to seek for additional custody of the accused to grill her thoroughly.
Meanwhile, the police official observed that the bank should have had checked the documents properly before issuing the loan amount of Rs.40 lakh in the name of Flemingstar Niangmih, the son of the accused."
256,Mookhep firing probe: State Govt seeks final report,"Sunday, August 9, 2015","SHILLONG: The State Government has sought a report from senior government official D.P. Wahlang, who could not proceed with the Mookhep firing probe in the absence of witnesses.
Earlier, Wahlang who was entrusted with the probe in March this year, had written to the Political Affairs department seeking its response on whether to carry on with the inquiry or stop the probe since no one had turned up for the hearing as part of the inquiry.
An official source said that though Wahlang could not carry on with the probe due to the non participation of the villagers, the Government has asked the official to compile a report.
Two villagers, Derestmon Siangshai and Setlang Phawa were killed and seven others injured on September 24 last year at Mookhep village in East Jaintia Hills when police fired at a mob which had blocked the National Highway.
The mob was protesting against the arrest of a person from Wapungskur village in connection with the attack on police and the magistrate the previous day during the economic blockade  against the apathy of the Government in addressing the issues related to ban on coal mining.
After the Government ordered a magisterial probe, the probe was submitted to the Government by the East Jaintia Hills Additional Deputy Commissioner SS Syiemlieh in November last year.
The State Government was not happy with the inquiry report as according to the Government, the report posed more queries than answers.
However, the pressure groups had asked the Government to make public the magisterial inquiry report, but in vain.
There was also a demand for a CBI probe into the incident, but the Government has not taken a decision."
257,Rape accused chowkidar’s bail plea scrapped,"Sunday, August 9, 2015","SHILLONG: The High Court of Meghalaya has rejected the bail application of a chowkidar of a school in North Garo Hills in a case related to sexual assault of a student.
The student, aged around 14 years, student of Class IX of Manikganj Secondary School, North Garo Hills, was sexually assaulted by the chowkidar of the school, Bhupen Rabha, who is alleged to have come from behind and grabbed her apparently with an intention to rape on July 8 this year.
The members of locality held a meeting wherein the accused admitted his guilt. The family of the victim approached the Headmaster the next day, but he could not give any satisfactory explanation and also refused to take any action till the examination was over.
The counsel for the petitioner    made a submission before the Court that the petitioner was a paralysis patient and had been undergoing treatment for the past two months.
However, Chief Justice Uma Nath Singh, in his order on August 3, said that the medical certificate annexed with the petition was dated 10.07.2015 “which appears to have been issued after the date of offence”.
The chowkidar had on July 10 moved an application for anticipatory bail before Additional District Magistrate, Resubelpara, North Garo Hills, which, however, was rejected.
“Looking to the background of the accused, I do not find any merit, inter alia, for the reason that the petitioner, being a chowkidar of the school, has committed serious breach of confidence of the student by his indulgence in sexual assault despite being in the position of protector and guardian,” the Chief Justice said.
According to the Chief Justice, the medical certificate submitted along with the petition also appears to be “an after-thought and basically designed to screen the offender from the allegation of commission of offence. Hence, this application for anticipatory bail is hereby rejected”."

The state government disbursed the stipend to the cadres till December last.  The ANVC-ANVC-B cadres had signed the peace pact with the Centre on September 24 last year, but the agreement did not specify the onetime financial package to the cadres.  As per the norm, all the ANVC and ANVC-B cadres are entitled to get Rs.2.5 lakh each as one time financial assistance which will have to be utilized for livelihood initiatives.
Moreover, the Agreed Text for Settlement signed on September 24,2014 with ANVC-ANVC-B did not specify any special economic package unlike the financial assistance of several crores of rupees announced by the Centre for  Bodoland Territorial Council  areas, Karbi Anglong Autonomous Territorial Council and  Dima Hasao Autonomous Territorial Council  for the next five years.

Stating that HSPDP called the rally on Thursday to mislead people, the NCP leader said that Basaiawmoit should remember the law is very clear that “unless the District Council gives its consent to MUDA, the MUDA cannot extend its jurisdiction to the Sixth Schedule area.”"
275,KHADC may move court on town planning Act,"Saturday, August 8, 2015","SHILLONG: KHADC CEM Pynshngaiñ N Syiem has reiterated that the implementation of the MUDA building bye-laws in the Sixth Schedule areas falling under the Council was ‘illegal’ while indicating that it (KHADC) would not hesitate to approach court seeking a correct interpretation of the Meghalaya Town and Country Planning Act.
Arguing that the move by MUDA is illegal, Syiem said that the chapter 1 preliminary of the Meghalaya Town and Country Planning Act, 1973, has clearly stated that building bye-laws will be applicable in the schedule areas only after receiving the consent of the Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
“We will not hesitate to approach court to give the correct interpretation of this section of the Meghalaya Town and Country Planning Act if the Government refuses to withdraw the notification issued by MUDA to extend its jurisdiction outside the municipal areas”, Syiem said on Friday.
According to Syiem, the section I (ii) of the Act, clearly states that it shall extend to the whole of Meghalaya excluding the Autonomous Districts “provided that if any District Council desires that all or any of the provisions of this Act should apply to the Autonomous District concerned, a notification may be issued to that effect and this Act shall then extend to that Autonomous District subject to such exceptions or modifications as may be specified in the notification”.
Syiem wanted to know on what basis MUDA proposes to implement the Meghalaya Building byelaws, 2011 in the Schedule areas without the consent of the Council.
Syiem said that it was also shocking to know that as per the notification of MUDA, the building bye-laws will be applicable as per the Shillong Master Plan.
He also questioned how the State Government can notify the Shillong Mater Plan without the consent of the Council.
Earlier, the Additional Chief Secretary in-charge urban and municipal affairs P. Naik had observed that the MUDA building byelaws will prevail over the KHADC byelaws.
While referring to the remarks of the Additional Chief Secretary, Syiem said that the statement of Naik does not hold any water as it was the act of the State Government which clearly stated that the MUDA building byelaws are not applicable in the schedule areas without the consent of the Council. “I do not see there is any confusion on this issue. This is a situation where the State Government is trying to violate its own law which it had formulated. Whatever observation I have made so far is purely with the provisions of the Act passed by the Government,” the KHADC CEM said.
Syiem also said that the Executive Committee of the Council will soon notify the creation of the Land Development and Building Regulation Branch which will be responsible for regulating the construction of building in the schedule areas.
He said that the new branch which will fall under the Town Committee department will have two architects, one Executive Engineer, two Assistant Engineers and two Town Planning Officers.
When asked if the creation of the new branch will be an additional burden to the Council, Executive Member in charge Town Committee department Antonio War said that said that this branch will be able to sustain itself in the long run since the Council will charge minimal fees for the building permission.
“We have already deliberated in the EC before taking the decision to set up the new branch,” he said."

SHILLONG: A day after Meghalaya High Court issued a bailable arrest warrant against the Director of NEIGRIHMS Dr AG Ahangar, Meghalaya police on Friday said it would ensure the latter’s presence in court on August 11.
Informing this, East Khasi Hills district police chief M Kharkrang said that Dr Ahangar at present is out of station.
A Division Bench of the High Court of Meghalaya on Thursday issued a bailable arrest warrant against Dr Ahangar for failing to appear before the court. The court also directed East Khasi Hills Superintendent of Police, Police Commissioner, Guwahati, and Police Commissioner, Delhi, to ensure his appearance in the court on August 11.
The High Court was hearing a writ petition filed in view of non-allocation of an MBBS seat to Sagarika Dawka, daughter of a NEIGRIHMS faculty, out of the Central Pool of MBBS seats allocated to Meghalaya.
KSU opposition: Meanwhile, the KSU has reiterated its opposition to any move to allocate two MBBS seats reserved for the State from the central pool to the wards of the faculties of NEIGRIHMS.
“Right from 2012, we have been opposing this move  to allocate two seats from the central pool. We had made our opposition to this move known to both the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the State Government,” KSU education cell chairman Donald V Thabah said while speaking to newsmen on Friday.
KSU Education Cell chairman said that as per the RTI documents which was filed by the union in 2013, a total number of 57 MBBS seats are allocated to Meghalaya.
“Out of these 57 seats, 22 seats are from the central pool and remaining 35 seats is from the State quota,” Thabah said.
“Since the reservation is for the children of faculty members of NEIGRIHMS, it is imperative on the part of the Centre to create additional seats to meet the requirements instead of encroaching upon the State quota,” he said.
He further stated that NEIGRIHMS should fight with Ministry for allocation of a separate medical seat for the ward of the faculties of the institute.
“We have no problem if NEIGRIHMS can make this internal arrangement with the Ministry. But we will not allow that the two seats reserved for the State would be given to the faculties of the institute,” Thabah said."

Alleging that the State Government wanted to implement the Ordinance with the intention of interfering into the affairs of the Council, Kharjahrin said, “This Ordinance will also take away the powers of the traditional heads.”
Claiming that there were many flaws in the Ordinance, the HYC leader said Section 2 Clause 6 of the Ordinance, which speaks about the Rangbah Shnong, allows non-tribals to take part in the election of the Rangbah Shnong.
“This Section is against the interest of the indigenous community and will create a division within the locality. It will give an opportunity to any individual to claim himself as the Rangbah Shnong,” the HYC general secretary said.
Kharjahrin, however, informed that the deputy chief minister had assured that he would ask the Law department to examine those provisions of the Ordinance which had been objected to by the HYC.
Meanwhile, reacting to the demand of the HYC, the deputy chief minister said the final decision to withdraw the Ordinance would be taken only during the next Assembly session."

Among the items found missing from the museum were gold, copper and silver ornaments, head chura (tiara) with red stones, antique coins, several artifacts, bamboo and cane materials  and unique garments of Khasi-Jaintia and Garo tribes worth several lakhs of rupees.
It was after the Accountant General (Audit), Shillong, during the inspection, discovered that the valuable items were missing that the Arts   and Culture Department filed an FIR on Tuesday.
However, questions are being raised as to why the AG (Audit) detected the matter only this year even though the present curator, who took over the museum in 2009, had remarked in the accession register that several items registered as brought to the State Museum were not available in the Museum. The Accession Register has the data from 1976."

Expressing concern over the sudden restriction imposed by the Forest department in issuing challans for export of limestone to Bangladesh around ten days ago, spokesperson of War Jaintia Lime Stone/ Boulder Stone Exporters’ Miners’ Association, Dolly Khonglah, informed news persons that the exporters had been paying royalty in advance to the Forest department and the cess to the Mines & Minerals department.
The affected exporters, hailing from the border areas of Dawki, Majai, Bakli, Mawlong and Shella, have urged the Government to resume issue of challans.
In this context, the exporters further wanted to know from the Government on whether there was a ban on supply of limestone to cement companies in the State.
Though the Forum is in the dark on the sudden decision to restrict the export of limestone, indications are that the action taken by the Forest    department was taken in accordance with the order of the High Court of Meghalaya.
The June 30 order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Meghalaya said,  “Except in cases where license for extraction of minerals has already been granted or lease deed for that purpose has already been entered into in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court, all other mining activities shall have to stop and in future the State shall not grant any license or enter into a lease deed for extraction of minerals without consultation with the CEC; drawing a comprehensive scheme; and creating a fund for reclamation in the interest of sustainable development and intergenerational equity, and for the purpose of rectifying the damage caused to the forest and environment.”"
280,Purno urges Centre for revival of irrigation project in WGH,"Saturday, August 8, 2015","New Delhi: Lok Sabha member from Tura and former Speaker of the Lower House, Purno A Sangma, on Friday urged the Centre to revive the much-needed Ronggai Valley Irrigation Project in West Garo Hills which, according to him, had been abandoned by the Meghalaya Government.
Sangma, along with former Meghalaya minister, Manirul Islam Sarkar, met Union Minister for Water Resources Uma Bharati here on Friday and said that the Ronggai Valley project would have given succour to thousands of people in the backward district.
He recalled that former Union Minister P.R. Kyndiah had sanctioned a bund-cum-road from Nidhanpur to Phulban to raise and protect both sides along the Knugai River which is a part the Ronggai Valley project.
Incidentally, the work on the project had started in 1990 when Sangma was the Chief Minister of Meghalaya.
However, the Government of Meghalaya had decided to abandon the project in its present form, Sangma said.
“Abandoning the project will be sort of snatching food of the people and leaving them to die of starvation,” he pointed out.
The failure of the State Government to contribute its share has led to this situation where the project has not taken off.
Nearly 5000 hectares of land would be irrigated and thousands of people would be saved from floods if this Centrally-approved project takes off, Sangma said.
“We therefore, strongly urge upon you to look into the above matter keeping in view the Green Revolution and to find ways and means to revive the project,” they told the union minister.
Meanwhile, a revised estimate of Rs.131.72 crore for the project has been already submitted to the Central Water Commission, it was informed."

293,HC issues warrant against NEIGRIHMS Director,"Friday, August 7, 2015","SHILLONG: A Division Bench of the High Court of Meghalaya on Thursday issued a bailable arrest warrant against NEIGRHIMS Director Dr. A.G. Ahangar for failing to appear before the court on Thursday.
While hearing a writ petition filed by a NEIGRIHMS faculty, Chief Justice Uma Nath Singh and Justice T.N.K. Singh stated that the bailable warrant was issued against the Director in the sum of Rs.20,000, with directions to East Khasi Hills Superintendent of Police, Police Commissioner, Guwahati, and Police Commissioner, Delhi, to secure his appearance in the court on August 11.
The High Court was hearing a writ petition filed in view of non-allocation of an MBBS seat to Sagarika Dawka, daughter of a NEIGRHIMS faculty, out of the Central Pool of MBBS seats allocated to Meghalaya.
In the order passed during the hearing of the writ petition on Wednesday, the Director of NEIGRIHMS and Director, Medical and Health Services, Govt. of Meghalaya, were asked to remain present in the Court on Thursday with records of the case for assistance.  “Today, when the case was taken up for hearing, the Court was informed that the Director, despite having knowledge about the order of this Court passed earlier and also yesterday requiring his appearance left for Guwahati to attend some meeting and from there he is scheduled to proceed to Delhi,” the order stated.
“The act of the Director in leaving Shillong on August 5, the date when directions were issued to require his appearance, is obviously with intention to defeat the directions of the Court and to avoid appearance. He is bereft of courtesy to show to Court and respect for the Rule of law and that is why he did not even file an application for exemption from personal appearance with his affidavit setting out the circumstances to suggest that he had no option but to leave for Guwahati and Delhi,” the order stated. The order also stated that such conduct of the Director only gives the impression that the authority suffers from a sense of inflated false ego and wants to put affront to the authority of the Court by disobeying orders directly or indirectly.
“It is also said that this Institute has become more a centre of politics than the professional excellence, perhaps in a rush for spending the huge public fund, said to have been made available to the Institute by the Central Government. Even the NEIGRIHMS counsel, R Deb Nath, has complaints to make against the Institute
for what happened to him when he had gone for preliminary health checkup,” the order stated.
Meanwhile, the order stated that it is common knowledge that all the life saving drugs and critical care medicines are not available in the NEIGRIHMS and even in Shillong, thus, the critical care units of the Institute become helpless in their efforts to save the life of patients.
Earlier, the NEIGHRIMS faculty member had filed a petition in the Court against non-allocation of an MBBS seat reserved for children of faculty members from the Central Pool.
Out of 22 MBBS seats allocated to Meghalaya from the Central Pool, two seats are reserved for children of faculty members of NEIGRIHMS.
In case of non-availability of eligible candidates from the Institute, the seats are to be utilized for other candidates of the State.
The petitioner, inter alia, pleaded that this was the one incentive which had attracted her to join NEIGRIHMS as a faculty member.
The petitioner joined as Asst. Professor, Physiology, on July 24, 2008, and thereafter, on March 8, 2013, she was appointed as Associate Professor, in that subject which she joined on March 8, 2015.
According to the petitioner, she has put in more than seven years of service as a faculty member and was a domiciled resident of Gauhati, Assam.
The court noted that the faculty member’s daughter, who passed Senior School Certificate Examination (Class-XII) 2015 from the Central Board of School Education in 2015, intended to pursue MBBS under the seats reserved for faculty members of NEIGRIHMS. She was the only candidate from the Institute contesting for admission against the two reserved MBBS seats.
The petitioner informed the Deputy Director, NEIGRIHMS, on July 28, 2014, that her daughter would be appearing in the Class XII examination in 2015 and wished to pursue medical studies against the reserved seats and subsequently submitted a letter to the Director, NEIGRIHMS, on March 13, 2015, reiterating her request but there was no response from the Director.
The petitioner submitted another representation on June 8, 2015, which also did not evoke any response.
The Court also observed that the petitioner had informed the court of a similar situation where another faculty member, Dr. A. Phukan, Department of Microbiology, had submitted an application for admission of his son in MBBS course against one of the two reserved seats and his application had been duly forwarded by the Deputy Director and Director of the NEIGRIHMS, at their level, to the Government of Meghalaya which had declined to provide the benefit to the candidate.
The court noted that it was not mandatory under the Circular of the Central Government creating the Central Pool that the faculty members should be domicile residents of Meghalaya."

Following a summon both the Assam chief secretary and Kamrup deputy commissioner were present in the court on Thursday and they have been asked to file an affidavit on the records related to the refugees which according to the officials were not available with them.
Earlier in May last year, the High Court, through a significant order, made it clear that Bangladeshi nationals who had settled in Meghalaya on or before March 24, 1971, should be treated as Indians and enrolled in the voters list.
Judge S.R. Sen had also issued    direction to the Ri Bhoi deputy commissioner to return citizenship certificates of the petitioners within a week.
The judgment said that the forefathers of the petitioners came to India in 1961 and were allowed to settle temporarily. There was mutual understanding between India and Bangladesh that the citizens of Bangladesh who came to India on or before March 24, 1971 shall not be repatriated to Bangladesh whereas those who came thereafter are to be deported.
However, being aggrieved, Meghalaya Government filed a writ appeal wherein, the records relating to issuance of citizenship certificates by the Deputy Commissioner, Kamrup, Assam were urgently required.
For this, the High Court of Meghalaya had sent several reminders to the DC, Kamrup, to appear in the Court.
On Wednesday, the High Court of Meghalaya had taken exception to the non appearance of the DC, Kamrup and directed him to appear on Thursday."

The MLA also took cognizance of the statement of Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Affairs, P. Naik that MUDA law applies in all master plan areas.
In his statement Naik had stated that MUDA building byelaws will prevail over KHADC building byelaws. However, it is clear that KHADC area does not fall under The Meghalaya Town & Country Planning Act, 1973 until consent has been given by the District Council.
Shullai stated that, “It seems Naik has not read The Meghalaya Town & Country Planning Act, 1973 properly and therefore he is not aware of Section 1 of The Meghalaya Town & Country Planning Act, 1973 which states that it shall extend to the whole of Meghalaya excluding the Autonomous District Provided that if any District Council desires that all or any of the provisions of this Act should apply to the Autonomous District concerned, a notification may be issued and this Act shall then extend to that Autonomous District subject to such exception or modification as may be specified in the notification”.
He said that Naik should restrain from giving such false statements as it may confuse the public as it is contrary to the law which clearly asserts that until and unless the District Council notifies its intention of including its area, The Meghalaya Town & Country Planning Act, 1973 shall not be applicable. He said they had also submitted a memorandum to the urban affair minister Ampareen Lyngdoh.
The construction of a high rise building at Jail Road was also questioned by him as Naik said that it was  . ft. “ I fail to understand the logic behind it, as
anyone constructing a building with more than 6000 Sq. ft. can go ahead violating the byelaws prescribed.
He asserted that the Meghalaya Town & Country Planning Act, 1973 has not been amended and so the extension of the Act to the whole master plan area is violation of the law time being in force.
He also said that MUDA is a foreigner to the Sixth Schedule area as MUDA jurisdiction is confined to European area only.
Ex-Cantonment Board members oppose Naik’s claim
Two former members of the Shillong Cantonment Board – Vijay Raj and S.P. Thapa have criticised Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Affairs, P. Naik, for his remarks that Shillong Cantonment falls under MUDA’s jurisdiction.
The two former members said that Shillong Cantonment is governed by the Centrally Legislated Act, The Cantonment Act, 2006 and that Shillong Cantonment has its own building byelaws.
Stating that the Shillong Cantonment has its own building byelaws which are totally different from MUDA byelaws, the duo said that they fail to understand as to how a Master Plan can be implemented entirely if the building byelaws are different within the Master Plan Area."

308,Museum theft: More than meets the eye,"Thursday, August 6, 2015","Gold ornaments, artifacts missing
SHILLONG: Gold, copper and silver ornaments, head chura with red stones, antique coins, artifacts, bamboo and cane materials  and unique garments  of Khasi-Jaintia and Garo tribes were the items worth several lakhs  of rupees found missing from State Museum ( Williamson Sangma  Museum) over many years.
It was after the Accountant General (Audit), Shillong found out the missing items recently during the inspection that the Arts and Culture Department filed an FIR with the police on Tuesday.
Police have started preliminary investigation on Tuesday itself, but sources said that there is a need to have a high level probe into the matte since the antique and unique items went missing over the past several years.
An official source said on Wednesday that the theft of museum pieces may have taken place before CCTV was installed in the museum before September 2008.
However, questions are being raised as to why the AG detected the matter only this year since the museologist who took over in 2009 had remarked in the Accession Register that several items registered as brought to the State  Museum were not available in the Museum. The Accession Register has the data from 1976.
A few of the unique gold ornaments were donated by D. Singh IAS who was Deputy Commissioner, Tura in 1976.
As per official records, the State Museum, Shillong was first established in 1975, under the Department of Education  and housed in the Legislative Assembly building. Initially, it was a small gallery with the display of a few collections.
When the Arts and Culture department was created in 1988, the entire exhibits were shifted to the State Museum building.
Earlier, the officers of Accountant General, Shillong had inspected records of the Director, Arts and Culture department for the period from August 2011 to December 2014.
As per the scrutiny of records carried out by the officers of Accountant General from February to March this year, Accession Register was maintained by Arts and Culture department. But the value of antiquities received as gifts was not evaluated and hence the value of the antiquities in the Accession Register was kept blank.
The audit party carried out a joint physical verification of antiquities along with the officials of the Arts and Culture department. Several items were found missing as per the verification.
The Accountant General suggested a thorough inquiry to be initiated by the Arts and Culture department.
Moreover, the senior audit officer had also written to the Director Arts and Culture to furnish reply of the department on the inspection report. Subsequently, the Director Arts and Culture asked the Museologist to submit the reply in June."
309,CCTV non-functional,"Thursday, August 6, 2015","Though the authorities say that the theft at state museum may have taken place before the installation of CCTV in 2008, the CCTV was functional only for limited period as the Arts and Culture department had in 2010 written to the operator to make it functional.
Sources said that the functioning of CCTV was short lived as after the company raised the bill, the Arts and Culture department could not pay the amount of money quoted. Moreover, there was technical snag on the equipments resulting in the non-functioning of CCTV. The fund for installation of CCTV was provided by Victoria Memorial Hall, Kolkata, as part of renovation of the present Museum.
Later in 2010, the department had written to the operator Diamond Electrical Stores, Pyrbot Villa, Laitumkhrah to make it functional, but in vain."

“It was surprising to see the State Government trying to misinterpret the tribunal order on July 31 by disallowing transportation of coal with immediate effect,” forum chairman Sonny Khyriem told reporters on Wednesday. He said that the State Government had interpreted by stating that the coal owners should first pay the royalty till September 30, adding that transportation of coal would be allowed only from October 1, that is once the royalty is paid.
“The State Government is trying to interpret the order to suit their convenience,” he said.
Meanwhile, he informed that a delegation of the forum will be meeting the Chief Secretary PBO Warjri on Thursday to deliberate on the NGT order.
Legal counsel of the forum Phuyosa Yobin has also questioned the Government for misinterpreting the order of the tribunal.
“I do not think there is any confusion since the order is very clear that payment of royalty is extended till September 30. At the same time, the transportation of coal is extended till November 30,” Yobin said.
He said that in the order, there is no mention that you first pay the royalty and then only transportation of coal will be allowed.
“If the State Government is restricting the transportation of coal then it is a clear case of wrong interpretation of the order,” Yobin added.
A member of the association Balios Swer informed that the District Mining Officer of Jaiñtia Hills had already issued more than 110 challans for transportation of coal.
‘Many of the coal owners have even started transportation of coal. It was only Wednesday that they have suddenly stopped the transportation,” Swer said."

NONGSTOIN: Absence of veterinary doctors and staff for long has forced residents of Malangkona village to send an SOS to the State Government through the MLA cum MDC of Rambrai-Jyrngam, K.P. Pangniang, to alleviate the grievances of livestock farmers by re-activating the veterinary hospital which has been predominantly dormant for almost ten years.
Residents of Malangkona area, especially farmers rearing cattle, have been hit hard by the absence of doctors and staff of the veterinary hospital for long. In times of need the residents have to transport sick animals to Boko in Assam for treatment, the villagers said.
Non functional veterinary hospitals in Malangkona and Aradonga, Athiabari stand as testimony to the wastage of public funds.
The villagers lamented that the veterinary hospital in Aradonga, Athiabari was in shambles since the staff have not attended to their duties for almost ten years now.
The villagers also questioned the State government for citing lack of resources on one hand and wasting crores of rupees on constructing veterinary offices and lakhs of rupees on paying salary to the veterinary staff who were of no use to the livestock farmers. “The staff collect their pay cheques from their respective offices and then go back to run their own businesses,” the exasperated villages grumbled.
Seeking immediate response to their pleas, residents of Athiabari submitted a memorandum to the Rambrai-Jyrngam legislator K.P. Pangniang related to the non functioning of the veterinary office and other related development issues.
Besides, demanding improvement of veterinary services, the residents of Malangkona also urged the State Government to set up a police outpost at Malangkona to prevent encroachment from Assam.
Among other demands, the residents sought up gradation of Malangkona sub centre to a primary health centre and setting up of an SSLC examination centre in the area for the benefit of hundreds of students coming from far flung areas.
While accepting the memorandum, Pangniang assured to take up the issues with the concerned departments and sought for cooperation from the people of the area for greater development of the region."

After Basaiawmoit wrote to the East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner PS Dkhar to verify the flags, an inquiry was conducted to ascertain the allegations.
The district administration said that the findings of the enquiry suggested that the flags displayed did not in any way resemble the National Flag of Pakistan.
Reacting to the adverse comments of Basaiawmoit on the flag, Lyngdoh said,”Leadership and responsibility are inseparable. When one doesn’t look closely enough, even the HSPDP flag looks  like the French flag. Should one not verify instead of jumping the gun? How can the patriotism of a community be questioned in such a casual manner? Even the politics of opportunism should have its limits”.
Several members from the mosques in the nearby localities of Them Mawbah held a meeting on Saturday and pointed out that the complaint was made by Basaiawmoit due to the ignorance as the flags were in fact festoons which were displayed as decoration on the occasion of Eid Ul Fitr, the major festival of the Muslims."
356,‘No misappropriation of funds in Khasi Heritage Village project’,"Tuesday, August 4, 2015","Always knew that there was no embezzlement, says KHADC CEM
SHILLONG: KHADC Chief Executive Member (CEM) Pynshngain N Syiem on Monday revealed that the report of the one-man inquiry headed by retired PWD (Buildings) Chief Engineer K. Najiar states that there was no misappropriation of funds in the implementation of the Khasi Heritage Village project at Mawphlang which had hosted the first edition of the Monolith Festival in 2013, and alleged that the previous Executive Committee under ARPA had constituted the inquiry in an act of political vendetta.
“As the per inquiry report, the total expenditure incurred in the project was Rs.4,32,44,914,” Syiem said while talking to newsmen here on Monday.
He said that the expenditures reflected in the inquiry report almost matches with the estimate of the KHADC project engineer who had indicated that the total expenditure was Rs.4,40,35,431.
“The Council had to bear additional expenditure since the area earmarked for digging of septic tanks had to be relocated as the designated spot contained rocks and not suited for digging,” the CEM said, adding that they had to relocate some of the construction work owing to similar problems.
“The Council had to spend an additional amount of Rs.5 lakh for construction of the septic tanks and also for shifting some construction work. The total expenditure will reach Rs.4,37,44,914 if we add this additional expenditure of Rs.5 lakh,” Syiem said.
He also mentioned that the difference in the amount mentioned in the inquiry report and the estimate made by the KHADC project engineer was less than three lakh rupees.
“We cannot avoid such minor lapses in any project where the expenditure is more than Rs.4 crore,” Syiem justified.
He also pointed out that the inquiry report mentions an amount of Rs.5.97 crore for the project (as per the DPR) whereas a total amount of Rs.8.13 crore was sanctioned for the heritage village project since the total area covered had increased to around 8 acres from the earlier estimate of 3 acres.
According to the KHADC chief, the consultant firm had been asked to prepare a DPR to cover an area of 3 acres only.
“It was only after we had started the construction work when we realized that we need to expand the project as it would have become too congested otherwise,” he said.
While informing that the Council had paid Rs.2.80 crore to the consultant firm, Syiem revealed that the KHADC would do away with a proposed road construction worth Rs.1.34 crore due to paucity of funds.
“We know that the State Government is constructing a road leading to the heritage village in view of the Terra Madre festival. It is also for this reason that we have scrapped the road construction,” Syiem said.
Meanwhile, the KHADC CEM termed the constitution of the inquiry as an ill-motive by the previous EC under ARPA.
Echoing similar views, Executive Member in charge Finance, Antonio War, said the inquiry was politically motivated with the intention to malign somebody.
“From the very beginning, we knew that there was no misappropriation of funds,” War said, adding that the inquiry report was submitted in January this year but since there was no misappropriation the EC under ARPA did not feel it necessary to make the report public.
“I am sure that they would have used the report if it was established that there was any appropriation of funds,” the EM said, while accusing the ARPA of playing ‘cheap politics’."
357,Congress-led EC blames ARPA for neglect of heritage village site,"Tuesday, August 4, 2015","SHILLONG: The Congress-led Executive Committee (PDF) has blamed the previous Executive Committee under ARPA for the deterioration of existing structures in the Khasi Heritage Village.
“The KHV was left unattended after the EC under ARPA had de-notified the Khasi Heritage Management Committee (KHMC) which was assigned with the responsibility of look after the village,” Executive Member in charge Finance, Antonio War, told newsmen here on Monday.
He said that the previous EC under KHUDA had wanted only elders of Hima Mawphlang and senior officers of the Council to be made members of the KHMC.
“We do not want any political leaders to be part of his committee since they do not stay in the Council for a long period. Once they lose an election, they are out of the Council. But the elders of Hima Mawphlang and senior officers of the Council would remain for long. It was for this reason we wanted that only the elders and officers should be the committee,” War said.
According to him, the committee had even started to collect fees for entry to the heritage village adding that they had even managed to pay the youth who had help in looking after the village from the collection they were making.
He said it was really unfortunate that the previous EC under ARPA had de-notified the committee and failed to make alternative arrangements leading to the present state where the entire structure is in shambles.
When asked if they were taking any political mileage by playing the ‘blame game’, he said that the decision making authority in the Council always remain with the EC.
Echoing similar views, KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem said that the failure of the Council was the failure of the EC.
“The officers in the Council cannot take any decision. All decisions are being taken by the EC. The arrangement in the Council is different with that of the State where the Chief Secretary also plays a critical role in the administrative affairs of the Government,” the KHADC CEM said.
He also said that he would soon lead an inspection to the heritage village site to ascertain the damages to the structures.     Meanwhile, Syiem informed that the Council was planning to organize the second edition of the Monolith Festival in November. “We would soon prepare the ground work for hosting of the festival,” he said.
Meanwhile, Khasi Heritage Conservation Forum (KHCF) member secretary Allan West Kharkongor said the members of the Forum were looking forward to taking up the responsibility of organizing the festival for the second time.
Kharkongor also informed that the total expenditures during the first edition of the Monolith Festival was Rs.68,68,375 as against the actual projection of Rs.97 lakh.
“We are happy that we had spent less than the actual projection,” the KHCF member secretary added."

366,Students’ body slams Govt over GH education scenario,"Tuesday, August 4, 2015","TURA: The A’chik Students’ Welfare Association (ASWA) has expressed resentment over the Government’s “apathetic attitude” towards the education scenario in Garo Hills.
The association lamented that several school education offices and schools in Garo Hills are without proper heads and officers.
“There is no Sub Divisional School Education Officer (SDSEO) at Dadenggre while Baghmara neither had a SDSEO nor a Joint Director of School Education Literacy (JDSEL). Another district headquarters without a JDSEL is Williamnagar,” the ASWA said.
The association also expressed disappointment over multiple charges being given to a single authority.
“During our visit to the ADSEL Office Tura we were shocked to find that one officer was in charge of three important posts, ADSEL, JDSEL and DSEO. The Government must act fast and eradicate such problems in the Education department,” the ASWA said.
“It is not possible for the students of Garo Hills to score high marks and gain experience when such important posts are left vacant. The Government schools and colleges in Garo Hills have become irrelevant without their heads and the same is greatly affecting the students,” it added.
Meanwhile in a separate statement the association also demanded enhancement of post matric scholarships which, according to  it should be disbursed at the beginning of the academic session.
Reminding that students of other states were receiving higher scholarship amounts than their counterparts in Meghalaya, the association urged the government to raise the scholarship amount to Rs 15,000 or Rs 20,000.
Currently, the scholarship amount is Rs 3000 to Rs 4000 for higher secondary and Rs 5000 to Rs 6000 for degree students."

Explaining the delay in signing of the peace pact, sources informed that the UALA was eager to know details of the rehabilitation package that would be provided to them whereas the Government was not sure what kind of rehabilitation would be provided to them.

379,Palliative Care members: Friends of the terminally ill,"Monday, August 3, 2015","SHILLONG: A woman, whose 50-year-old husband is suffering from throat cancer, is pleasantly surprised and curious as to why some volunteers have been regularly visiting their home and providing necessary care and solace to the ailing patient.
The group of volunteers has made as many as 24 visits to provide support and care to patients in several households.
The group known as the ‘Palliative Care Members and Volunteers’ have been rendering yeoman service to patients in need of care and attention.
Another family that had to cater to the needs of their critically ill relative, and had no hopes left, came into contact with Palliative Care Members and Volunteers. They family is now at a loss for words to express their gratefulness to the volunteers who generously donate their time, energy and efforts for the care of the patients right in their homes.
Palliative Care is a multi-disciplinary holistic approach to specialized medical care for people with terminal illness, which is why, it continues to provide the patient (and his family) with the necessary services for his comfort and care and also allows them to come to terms with the patient’s terminal condition and also to recognize that a lot could still be done so that the process of dying should not necessarily be full of suffering and pain.
Palliative care focuses on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of a serious illness.
Dr. P. Bhattacharyya, Head of Department, Anesthesiology & Critical Care Unit, NEIGRIHMS, said that  the goal of such therapy is to formulate an approach which improves the quality of care for patients (as well as their families) – an approach which addresses the problems associated with life-limiting illnesses, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems –  physical, psychosocial and spiritual.
Palliative care is provided by a team through the combined efforts of doctors, nurses, counselors, social workers and any individual with an inclination to contribute towards addressing humanitarian needs.
Teams with members from various walks of life, based on their geographical location, set out to provide holistic care (including home care treatment) through, in social terms, an ‘outreach programme’.
The patient can – if he/she may so choose – to die in their own homes, surrounded by their family members.
The palliative care team attends to the patients’ needs ensuring that he or she is provided with an extra layer of support.
The team has been venturing out from house to house helping cancer patients and till date they have visited numerous patients in an around Shillong with the goal of making available palliative treatment by providing: relief from suffering, treatment of pain and other distressing symptoms, psychological and spiritual care, as well as a support system to help the individual live as actively as possible and a support system to sustain and rehabilitate the individual’s family."
380,Never displayed Pak flags: Mosques,"Monday, August 3, 2015","SHILLONG: Following HSPDP legislator Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit’s allegation that “Pakistani flags” were spotted in Them Mawbah, Upper Mawprem, various mosques from the nearby localities held a meeting on Saturday to discuss the matter.
In the meeting attended by members of Masjid Bilal,  Madina Masjid,  Jhalupara,  Mohammadia Al Hussainee Mosque, Barapathar and Talim Gah, Jhalupara it was felt that the complaint was made as a result of ignorance since the flags in question were festoons which were displayed as decoration on the occasion of Eid Ul Fitre, the biggest festival of the Muslims.
“The organizers of the Eid celebrations never had any intention of displaying flags of any country,” a statement released after the meeting said.
The statement further said that every community has its own symbol. “The Sein Raij has the Cock as its symbol, the Christians have the Cross, Hindus have Swastik and similarly, the Muslims have Crescent with the stars as their religious symbol,” the statement said.
The meeting further hoped that the authorities would not give any weightage to such complaints in the larger interest of communal harmony.
It may be mentioned that the East Khasi Hills district administration, after an inquiry on Saturday, had clarified that the flags in question were in no way related to Pakistan. The district administration had also taken exception to the view of the HSPDP legislator due to the sensitivity of the matter.

FKJGP president Joe Marwein, on Sunday, said the pressure groups will seek an appointment with the government on Monday to know the status of the initiatives being taken by the administration to implement the comprehensive mechanism proposal to address the issue of influx.

He disclosed that the pressure groups had met on Friday to discuss the issue of creation of entry and exit points in the state.
“We had also met the deputy commissioners of Ri Bhoi and Jaintia Hills to know the progress in setting up of entry and exit points and we were told that the survey for land has already been carried out,” Marwein said.
According to Marwein, though survey has been carried out, the Government is yet to take any concrete step to set up entry and exit points, as had been promised.
“We have to rethink our strategy if the State Government does not take steps to set up the entry and exit points in the State,” the FKJGP leader warned."

398,‘Dr Kalam will stand out for his humility and simplicity’,"Sunday, August 2, 2015","SHILLONG: ICARE on Saturday organised a condolence meet for former President, late APJ Abdul Kalam who breathed his last in Shillong on July 27. Citizens from different walks of life attended the solemn meet where rich tributes were paid to the former President.
Spokesperson for the Grand Council of Chiefs, John Kharshiing who had accompanied the local traditional healers to meet Dr Kalam during his tenure as president said, he gave the 20 odd healers more time than scheduled, listened to each one of them and accepted the herbs they had brought to show him.
“One lady healer had brought some medicine for intestinal discomfort in a Coca Cola bottle and offered it to the former President. He told her he did not take Coca Cola but she insisted that he take the medicine she had prepared. Only later did Dr Kalam know she had brought medicine in a Coca Cola bottle.”
Dr Kalam summoned the forest officials and asked them to take note of each of the herbal medicinal plants brought by the healers. When he came to the youngest traditional healer, Alka Kharsati, Dr Kalam asked her if she was the daughter of one of the herbalists. When she said that she was a healer he asked her from whom she had learnt the trade. Kharsati said her grandmother had passed on the healing wisdom to her. Dr Kalam was surprised that a grandmother had so much faith in her grand-daughter as to pass on the ancient wisdom to her.
When some of the healers said that they were not formally recognised and that made it difficult to practice their trade, Dr Kalam said, “Tell everyone that the President of India recognises you and has met you at Rashtrapati Bhavan. However you have to blend traditional knowledge with science.”
Peter Sailo, administrator, Bethany Hospital narrated the tension-ridden moments of July 27 evening when Dr Kalam was brought to the hospital after he collapsed during his lecture at IIM Shillong. Recalling those harrowing moments, Sailo said, “By the time Dr Kalam was brought here he had already expired but we had a duty to resuscitate him in the ICU. When all that failed the challenge before us was how to declare the former President dead. How do we do it? How are we supposed to know protocol? Also we had so many calls from so many quarters including the national media which we found difficult to respond to.”
He expressed his gratitude to Home Minister, Roshan Warjri who arrived on time and helped the hospital staff to deal with the dignitaries who had gathered there from different institutions such as the military etc., “She handled the situation wisely,” Sailo said adding that the Chief Secretary PBO Warjri also handled things calmly.
Stating that he wanted to thank the people of Shillong for remaining calm Sailo said it helped then to deal with the situation better.
Dr Adorable Kharbamon, medical specialist who attended on Dr Kalam at Bethany Hospital said it is a bitter-sweet emotion. “In his death Dr Kalam has glorified Shillong whose location many Indians still don’t know. I studied medicine in Allahabad and many of my peers and elders did not know that Shillong is in Meghalaya. For us at Bethany it was both a privilege to have handled the former President and a dilemma to have to declare him dead,” Kharbamon said.
The constable who was feted by Dr Kalam for standing guard on the pilot car for over two hours, Flint Anderson Lapang was emotional while paying his tribute to Dr Kalam. He narrated the events of that evening saying that when he was called to the IIM Guest House by Dr Kalam’s aide he was trembling with fear. “I was wondering if I had done anything wrong. But at that moment Dr Kalam extended his hand and thanked me saying that I had been standing with the gun for a long time. He asked me if I had something to eat. I don’t think anyone before Dr Kalam had ever taken notice of me,” Lapang said. He prayed that the former President’s soul would rest in peace.
East Khasi Hills SP, M Kharkrang who also came to pay his tribute said, “When I heard that the former President had taken ill I too rushed to Bethany Hospital after informing my seniors. Some of my boys informed me how Dr Kalam had thanked constable Lapang.  For Dr Kalam thanking a junior is his way of life. For us we expect our boys to do their job well. Today we need to introspect why this great man came all the way to die in this humble city of Shillong. I have been in the service for the past 20 years but I cannot recollect any VIP or VVIP ever telling any of my boys, ‘You have done a good job.’ In death Dr Kalam has proved himself a great yet humble man,” a visibly moved Kharkrang said, adding that paying tribute to this soul can only be by imbibing his ideals and his way of life.
Senior journalist, BP Domes said Dr Kalam was a rocket scientist who could explain things in simple language. “He saw immense potential in the most insignificant person and inspired them to give their best. But what strikes me as the greatest attribute of Dr Kalam is that he never wore religion on his sleeve. His death in Shillong is divine providence. I believe this city despite its many ills is still the stairway to the Gods,” Domes said.
Other speakers also paid rich tributes to Dr Kalam.
Meanwhile Toki Blah, President ICARE said he was happy that ICARE could provide a platform for the meaningful homage to Dr Kalam in the Sein Jaintia Hall which would be demolished next week to make way for a better infrastructure.
The condolence meeting concluded with a closing prayer from Rev WC Khongwir of Jaiaw Presbyterian Church.
Our New Delhi Correspondent adds
Meghalaya Police constable, F A Lapang, who was praised by late President Abdul Kalam for his dedication to duty prayed that his life to be taken away instead of the former Presidents’ when the latter was taken to Bethany hospital in Shillong.
“I kept praying for miracles to happen so that he could come back to the auditorium and I am again able to talk to him while seeing him off at Guwahati Airport on Thursday,” said a teary eyed Lapang.
“While taking him to the hospital in the same car in which he travelled from Guwahati to Shillong, I was continuously praying to God. The desperation was so much that I asked God to take my life and revive Kalam Sir,” he said.
Meanwhile, two Imams of the Madina Masjid who kept awake the whole night reciting the Holy Quran beside Kalam’s body, can’t still get over their memories.
“We have performed such religious rights for many but we will never forget that moment,” they said.
Sayeedullah Nongrum, former minister and patron of the Glass Mosque had requested the two Imams to perform all religious rites without fail."

Prof Basab Roy Choudhury of IIM Shillong who was in attendance during Dr Kalam’s last lecture shared some significant facets of the former Presidents character traits. He said Dr Kalam was so humble that he would even ask the professors at IIM if his lectures were fine or if there was something that he could improve upon.
“At IIMs what is uppermost in the students’ minds is how to make a career but Dr Kalam is perhaps the only teacher who could inspire students to think beyond their careers and consider the plight of poorer Indians and the larger problems of the country; of thinking beyond the self,” Prof Roy Choudhury said, adding that Dr Kalam conveyed his message in simple language.  “After listening to Dr Kalam’s lectures I have realised that you don’t need to be great to convey a great message,” the IIM Professor stated.
Prof Roy Choudhury said he was the time keeper for Dr Kalam’s classes and while he would get exhausted sitting for lectures from 9 am to 6 pm with a short break of two hours, Dr Kalam was never tired. When students presented their assignments and the time had exceeded, professors would be looking at their watches, but Dr Kalam would say, “Let us hear them out. After all they have worked for it,” Prof Roy Choudhury shared.
He said Dr Kalam had a fantastic memory and enquired about things that many would not have considered important enough such as the status of the permanent campus of the IIM etc.
Other members of the audience paid their own heartfelt tributes to the former President after which excerpts were read out from his book ‘Transcendence:  My spiritual experience with Pramukh Swamiji”, which revealed Dr Kalam’s deep spirituality and his belief that forgiveness is the human quality which can create positive, creative energy and propel humans to greater spiritual heights while an unforgiving, revengeful nature is like being confined in a dark prison.
Two teachers of Chemistry of St Mary’s College shared their emotional moments when they heard of Dr Kalam’s demise.
“I don’t know why but I felt as if I lost a family member, someone my grandfather’s age and I wept,” the teacher said.
Others echoed her feelings.
Former tea planter, Danny Pariat said he was struck by Dr Kalam’s punctuality as narrated by Prof Roy Choudhury. He said this was a quality that is missing among the people of Meghalaya including its leaders who keep people waiting for hours.
“If there is one thing we need to imbibe from the former President then punctuality is that quality,” Pariat said.
Younger students said they would emulate Dr Kalam’s noble virtues of humility and simplicity- a simplicity which in itself is a sophistication as one speaker observed.
The meeting which was chaired by senior advocate Khalid Khan ended on a sombre note by observing a minute’s silence in honour of Dr Kalam."
400,KSU concerned over irregularities in educational institutions,"Sunday, August 2, 2015","Calls for formation of regulatory board
SHILLONG: Concerned over the “growing irregularities” in the functioning of schools and colleges in the city, the KSU has demanded the State Government to set up a regulatory body similar to the Meghalaya Private Universities Regulatory Board (MPURB) to monitor the educational institutions.
In a statement issued here chairman of the education cell of the KSU, Donald V Thabah termed the exorbitant fee hikes by some educational institutions, mostly private ones, as totally unjustified and called for the need to have a regulatory board to monitor such irregularities.
“The fee hike is adversely affecting students, especially those from the lower income families,” Thabah said adding that certain institutes seem interested only in minting money.
He also questioned the arrangement that several schools have with retailers when it comes to purchase of books and uniforms.
“This has led to monopoly by some to suit the interests of some schools,” the KSU education cell chairman alleged.
He also raised concern over the frequent change of syllabus for different levels (Class I-VI) which has created confusion among the students’ community.
The Union also urged the government to ensure free and compulsory education to all till the age of 14 which is in accordance with Article 45 of the Constitution of India.
Thabah was also of the opinion that the MBOSE like other boards in the country should adopted the NCERT curriculum so as to ensure that students of the State are at par with students from across the country.
The Union also condoled the sudden demise of former President, late Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.
“The demise of Dr. Kalam is a huge loss to the entire nation as he was a practical thinker and a visionary who had contributed immensely in numerous fields for the development of a balanced Indian society,” Thabah said."

SHILLONG/JOWAI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has extended the time for transportation of extracted coal till November 30 even as it has reiterated that no mining will be allowed unless the state government has come up with a mining policy and mining plan.
The Supreme Court lawyer and counsel for Meghalaya Government Ranjan Mukherjee said over phone from Delhi that while the payment of royalty has been allowed till September 30, the extended date for transportation of extracted coal is November 30.
Another important ruling of NGT was that 10% of the royalty meant for ecological restoration will not be applicable to those have already transported coal after paying royalty before March 31 this year, Mukherjee said.
This means that the 10% fine will be effective only from April this year.

The next hearing will be held on September 28 and 29 in Shillong.

408,Delete ‘will’ from land Act: HC,"Saturday, August 1, 2015","SHILLONG: The High Court of Meghalaya has directed the State Government to delete “will” from the Meghalaya Land Transfer Amendment Act, 2012 by stating that the Government has no power to include ‘Will’ in the Act.
Hearing a petition, the Judge of the High Court of Meghalaya Justice SR Sen on Friday in his order said that  the inclusion of “WILL” has to be struck down as illegal since the State legislature cannot overstep in the field of Union list while legislating law.
“The issue of succession is solely in the field of the Union list and not in concurrent list. The insertion of WILL in clause 2 (d) of the Meghalaya Land Transfer Amendment Act, 2012 is blatant case of illegal legislation. The subsequent amendment in section 3A restricting the devolution of property only to immediate family members will have to meet the same fate and to be struck down”, the High Court said
The case in point is the plot of land bearing No. 4 with an area of 0.221 acres at G.C. Phukan’s Land, New Colony, Laitumkhrah which was allotted by the then Government of  Assam on 09.02.1954 to one  Prabhat Chandra  Deka. The  piece of land was subsequently settled in favour of Prabhat Chandra Deka by the Deputy Commissioner, Khasi and Jaintia Hills, on 02.02.1970 vide Lease Agreement dated 12.01.1970.
During his lifetime, Prabhat Chandra Deka wanted to sell the plot of land to one Indrajit Dutta from whom he took financial assistance regularly and could not repay. Considering their long friendship and mutual love and affection, Prabhat Chandra Deka made a ‘WILL’ bequeathing the property to Indrajit Dutta and in the alternative to Bimol Deb (Respondent No. 1).
On execution of the Will, Prabhat Chandra Deka handed over physical possession of the land to Indrajit Dutta along with all the title documents and Prabhat Chandra Deka died on 22.07.1989 and Indrajit Dutta died on 21.04.2007 without probating the Will. The respondent No. 1 (Bimol Dey) on November 11, 2008 filed an application Under Section 276 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 praying for probate of the Will. The learned Additional Deputy Commissioner, Shillong granted probate in favour of Bimol Deb vide order dated 24.02.2009.
After obtaining the probate, Bimol Deb on 15.07.2009 filed an application for mutation of the  land in his name, but the same was rejected by the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Shillong vide order dated 07.08.2009. The respondent No. 2  Sisir Kumar Deka,  who is the only son of late  Prabhat Chandra Deka filed an application for mutation of the plot of land in his name in the year 1999 i.e. during the lifetime of late Indrajit Dutta, and since no objection was filed against the proposed mutation from the side of  Indrajit Dutta or Bimol Deb  or by any other persons, the mutation was granted in favour of the respondent No 2.
Being aggrieved by the order dated 07.08.2009 passed by the learned Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Shillong rejecting the application for mutation, the respondent No. 1 preferred an appeal Under Section 147 of the Assam and Revenue Regulation, 1886 before the Meghalaya Board of Revenue. After hearing the parties, the Meghalaya Board of Revenue vide order dated 20.01.2010 allowed the appeal and set aside the order dated 07.08.2009 on the ground that the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue), Shillong has not taken due note of the evidentiary value of the probate order in deciding the ownership of the property while passing the impugned order dated 07.08.2009 rejecting the mutation application of the respondent No. 1. Being aggrieved by the order dated 20.01.2010 passed by the Meghalaya Board of Revenue; Meghalaya filed the current writ petition.
The High Court upheld the order of Meghalaya Board of Revenue while viewing that the actual definition of Will under Section 2 Clause (h) of the Indian Succession Act, 1925 means the legal declaration of the intention of a testator with respect to his property which he desires to be carried into effect after his death.
The Court said that the Meghalaya Land Transfer Amendment Act No. 11 of 2012 has been wrongly legislated by bringing the “WILL” within the meaning of transfer of any other mode of transfer of property. Insertion of “WILL” at 2(d) of the Meghalaya Land Transfer Amendment Act No. 11 of 2012 is illegal and blatant case of overstepping legislative competence laid down under the Constitution of India, the Court observed.
According to the Judge, there is no definition that, “transfer of property” shall also include within its meaning “WILL” under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
The High Court said that “Will” has a specific definition under the Indian Succession Act, 1925, but there is no definition of Transfer under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 or Meghalaya Land Transfer Act, 1971. The only definition is “transfer of property” under the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
“State legislature has got no locus standi to amend and modify or restrict the meaning of Will, whose power to define rests solely with the parliament and the parliament has already defined. State has got no legal authority to give any expanded or restricted meaning of “WILL”."

410,Ardent spots ‘Pak flags’ in city locality,"Saturday, August 1, 2015","SHILLONG: HSPDP legislator Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit has written to the state authorities alleging that ‘Pakistani flags’ were spotted in a locality of the state capital.
According to the Nongkrem MLA, he spotted Pakistani flags hanging across the road at Them Mawbah, Upper Mawprem.
“I fail to understand as to how Pakistani flags are allowed to be displayed in the open,” Basaiawmoit said in a letter addressed to East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner PS Dkhar on Friday.
He said this was an inexcusable and an open insult to the people of Meghalaya in particular and all Indians in general.
“It also amounts to attraction of Section 124 – A of the Indian Penal Code,” the HSPDP MLA said in the letter.
Demanding immediate investigation and verification to find out those who were behind such illegal activity, the legislator said stringent action should also be  taken against house owners who seem to be in connivance with such elements by allowing their buildings to be used for such purpose.
According to him, it would be fair and just to take the Officer – in – Charge of a concerned Police Station and even the Headman of this particular locality into task for failing to prevent such outrageous activity and perform their duties.
When contacted, East Khasi Hills SP M Kharkrang said that he was yet to receive the complaint letter.
“I will order an inquiry into this matter once I get the copy of the complaint from the DC,” he said."

423,KSU opposed to ‘politicization’ of special purpose vehicle,"Saturday, August 1, 2015","SHILLONG: The KSU Nongtrai unit, in collaboration with the KSU South West Khasi Hills District unit, has opposed the decision to appoint the East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner as ex-officio Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Society on the ground that this decision espouses an arrangement which goes against the spirit inherent in the Supreme Court’s order as well as other policy alterations made in the functional framework of the Society.
The KSU said that the order of the Supreme Court of India has mandated upon the SPV to utilize funds which Lafarge Umiam Mining Private Limited (LUMPL) is bound to contribute at the rate of Rs.90 per ton of mined limestone, towards welfare project, especially for the development of health, education, economy, irrigation and agriculture in the project area of 50 km.
The Union said that it was opposed to any policy alteration in the functional framework of the Society to facilitate the planning, sanction, execution, implementation and monitoring of welfare and development schemes in the project area by and through governmental departments.
“Accordingly, the Union refuses to accept the appointment of an official in service office (East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner’s Office) to the post of the CEO as it is bound to make the SPVS highly vulnerable to political pressures,” the Union said.
The Union also opposed the character of the composition of the ‘Executive Committee’ which is set up ‘for the purpose of scrutiny of annual work plans, identification of implementing agencies and field supervision of projects taken up for implementation’.
The Union also questioned the parameters applied by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, in establishing the ‘reputedness’ of any State-based NGO that is mandated to be a member of the SPY Committee.
The Union further demanded that the State government should formulate a list of parameters applied in the aforesaid process before recommending the name of any NGO to the Ministry of Environment and Forests."
424,Glass Mosque library in city to be named after ‘missile man’,"Friday, July 31, 2015","Dominic Jala compares Kalam to Pope Francis
SHILLONG: A library on Islamic studies located at the Madina Masjid (Glass Mosque) in the city will be dedicated to Late Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam who passed away in Shillong on July 27. The library which is scheduled to be inaugurated soon will be christened ‘APJ Abdul Kalam Islamic Library’.
This was announced by Sayeedullah Nongrum, general secretary of Shillong Muslim Union, on Thursday after a special prayer.
The ritual Namazee-Zanajah-Gyabana (Islamic ritual prayer in absentia for the departed) was performed at Madina Mosque, simultaneously when a similar ritual was being performed at Rameswaram for the eternal peace of former President Dr. Kalam on Thursday. A large number of Muslim faithful gathered and prayed for the departed soul in the city.
Earlier, on Wednesday, the Shillong Muslim Union along with Meghalaya State Wakf Board, faculty and  students of Umshyrpi College and Meghalaya Taekwondo Association jointly held a condolence meeting at the Laban Eid Gah.
Nongrum recalled that in the presence of the mortal remains of former President, recitation of Koran for the whole night was conducted by two Imas of Madinah Mosque and Laitumkhrah Eid Gah as per customs and practices of Islam from the night of July 27 till July 28 morning.
Irrespective of caste, creed and religious affiliations, several organizations and educational institutions in the city bid adieu to the peoples’ President.
The  Rajiv Gandhi Indian Institute of Management, observed Shraddhanjali in honour of late Dr. Kalam from 6:15 pm till 9:30 pm at the IIM Campus, Mayurbanj Complex, Nongthymmai, where Dr. Kalam had addressed the students for the last time on July 27 evening.
Many prominent citizens and religious leaders recalled the contribution of Dr. Kalam towards the nation.
City based advocate, F. Qureishi, said that as President, Dr. Kalam was never a ‘rubber stamp’.
“He was very dynamic, sincere and pro-active and his ideals should be emulated,” Qureishi said.
Archbishop Dominic Jala recalled that he had met Dr. Kalam during a function at St. Anthony’s College, Shillong.
Comparing Dr. Kalam to Pope Francis, Jala said that the former President was a person who could communicate with people with all humility.
Though aged, he was active in serving the people, the Archbishop said, adding that like the present Pope Francis, he was man of the people. “He was deeply humane and connected to people and among the Presidents of the country, he was more prominent,” Jala said.
The Archbishop said the talk Dr. Kalam delivered in the Meghalaya Assembly on a vision for Meghalaya in 2020 should be practiced in the State as he gave simple solution to the problems plaguing the State.
The Archbishop said that Dr. Kalam will be remembered during the mass on Sunday next in all the Catholic churches.
A group of nuns led by Sr. Marcellina Sangma, Provincial Administrator, Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco, Auxilium, Shillong, had the rare opportunity to pay tribute to the mortal remains of Dr. Kalam at Upper Shillong during the guard of honour on July 28 morning.
Sr. Sangma had laid the wreath and prayed for the departed soul.
The nuns after hearing the news of Dr. Kalam’s demise had visited Bethany Hospital, but in vain as the body had already been taken to Military Hospital.
Sr. Elizabeth, who was part of the group, said that after reaching Military Hospital they requested the guard to allow them to pay respect to Dr. Kalam at the Hospital.
Though the request was denied, they were allowed to pay tribute to Dr. Kalam at Upper Shillong Advance Landing Ground where his body was kept for guard of honour.
“The passing away of Dr. Kalam re-awakens a true spirit of patriotism in each of us as citizens of India. His physical presence is no more with us but his words of wisdom will linger on in our hearts and minds,” the sisters said, adding that he will be looked upon as an icon of integrity."

433,Gram sevika row: Tynsong defends 2010 appointments,"Friday, July 31, 2015","SHILLONG: Community and Rural Development (C&RD) Minister Prestone Tynsong on Thursday defended the decision of the department to make appointments to the post of gram sevikas on “compassionate ground” in 2010.
The decision was questioned by the HYC on Wednesday on grounds that the system was done away with by the Government in 2008. Tynsong, however, said that the Cabinet had decided to entertain applications for appointment on “compassionate ground” till October 2010.
“The Government had taken the decision to do away with the policy of appointment on “compassionate ground” on the basis of recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission,” the C&RD Minister said adding that the Government had also constituted a committee to study this recommendation.
Tynsong further said that after through deliberations the Government decided to entrust Commissioner and Secretary in charge Personnel department, RV Suchiang to examine the applications on compassionate ground for the gazetted post.
He said that at the same time, the Under Secretary of the Personnel department was authorized to examine the applications for appointment on compassionate ground for lower rank posts.
“As per information available with me, over 500 applications were received by the Government for appointment on compassionate ground in the various Government departments. I do not have the information on the total number of the applications which have been already disposed of,” C&RD Minister said.
Referring to the cases which were raised by the HYC, Tynsong said, “These are probably not new cases and were submitted to the department before the Cabinet decided to do away with appointments on compassionate ground.”
Tynsong added that the department had taken the decision to appoint two gram sevikas on compassionate ground in 2010 after studying “the merit of the case”.
He was distressed that attempts were made to blame the department for encouraging “backdoor appointment”.
When asked about the fate of the eight qualified gram sevika candidates who are on an indefinite hunger strike for the past 18 days, he said that the decision for extension of the merit list will have to be taken by the Personnel department.
“I have confirmed that there are two vacant posts at present with the department. We will not delay appointment once the merit list is extended,” the C&RD Minister said.
He, however, said that the merit list cannot be extended beyond a permissible limit.
“We cannot create any new post of gram sevika,” Tynsong said adding that even if the merit list is extended the government will appoint only two of the agitating gram sevika candidates."

435,Six children rescued from circus at Nongpoh,"Friday, July 31, 2015","Shillong: The District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) of Ri Bhoi District, Nongpoh, led by District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) along with District Police rescued six children who were performing in a mini circus at Nongpoh in contravention to the Juvenile Justice Act. After receiving necessary inputs about the children, the Department in a recent meeting comprising of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) Chairperson, Member Secretary, the members of the CWC and the DCPU team made necessary arrangement to escort the children back to Phaphund, Uttar Pradesh.
It may be mentioned that on July 9, the DCPO received a phone call informing of a mini circus performed by three children at Nongpoh proper.
On reaching the spot where the circus was being held, the DCPO and social workers found that the children were performing dangerous acts. While one of the boys was piercing his eye with a needle, another child was walking on stilts; a little boy of around 6 years was collecting money from the public who had gathered around. Instantly, the DCPO informed the Nongpoh Police Station. It was only when the police reached the spot that one lady (Soneveer) claimed to be the mother of these children and also claimed to have permission to perform the circus. With the assistance from the police, the children were taken to the Police Station.
At the police station the team learned that there was another group of children consisting of two boys and one girl performing near Bethany Hospital, Nongpoh.
The police team went to the spot and took them to the Police Station. The only document produced at the Police Station was a copy of the voter card of Soneveer and permission letters from different places.
The documents produced later (by the woman who claimed to be the mother) showed applications for permission to perform circus at various places like Gangtok, Darjeeling, Bhutan, Nepal, etc. However, all the documents were found invalid since they were from 2014. There were no legal papers found except for the copy of the voter card of the woman. The DCPO immediately informed the CWC about the children and arrangements were made to accommodate them at Government Children’s Home for Boys and Girls, while the woman was taken to Missionaries of Charity, Nongpoh.
On July 10, one Jitesh Kumar, who claimed to be an elder brother of some of the children, produced copies of his Aadhar card, Headman certificate from Phaphund (UP), the various permission letters they received from places where they have performed and a copy of a Post Office Savings Account Passbook of one Javar Singh (who claimed to the husband of Soneveer). Post questioning, the team learned that there are around 8 such groups who intended to join this group. Other groups might be scattered in West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam.
This group of people originally hails from Uttar Pradesh, however, since they move around performing circus, they have been staying in Nepal for the last 12 years, but the aftermath of the earthquake forced them to leave Nepal and approach this side of the country to earn their livelihood."

Dango to ensure that a footbridge over Tynhiang River, lying incomplete for the last 16 years, be completed at the earliest.
According to villagers, the contract for the construction of the foot bridge was first allotted to a party worker of the local MLA in 1999 at an estimated cost of Rs. 1.50 lakh. The contractor, however, only constructed two pillars of the foot bridge before abandoning the work.
A decade later, Dango allegedly handed over the construction work to another party worker at an estimated cost of Rs. 4 Lakh. This time too, the contractor discontinued the work after building two pillars.
It may be mentioned that people of the area are forced to cross the river on foot and the same becomes an extremely dangerous affair during the rainy season.  “Every day we cross the river to go to school and on our way back home but in the rainy season we are forced to skip classes for days,” said one of the students.
R.Marthong resident of Mawjai says that during the rainy season, the water level rises to three meters which not only affects students, but everyone, as the adults are unable to go to the market or get to their fields.
“We don’t know when a bridge will be built over the river. This is what we need so that our children can go to school safely,” says Marthong, who hopes that the local MLA will one day rebuild the incomplete bridge.
“Every day, these brave children make this journey without complaint, with smiles on their faces and hope in their hearts, all to seek out an education to make a better life for their future,” Marthong said adding that the local MLA should visit the place to see the plight of the people."

While the body of the aged trader, Abdul Mannan, was located a day later in Damalgre jungle, near Tura, with a bullet wound to his head, the whereabouts of his 12 year old grandson, Md. Aziz Zamal, remained a mystery.
Following the arrest of five gang members, two others surrendered before the court and have been taken into custody by the police who have been relentlessly pursuing the group behind the kidnap of the innocent young boy.
Manan and grandson Md. Aziz Zamal have also been recovered.
A motorcycle (ML08 C 3756) belonging to Lengdang that was used to collect the ransom money from the victims family at the Dobasipara petrol pump has also been seized.
While the search continues for the missing boy, almost two months to the day he was kidnapped while accompanying his grandfather on his business work to Ampati from Mankachar town, the police investigation has revealed that the leader of the criminal gang is Salgrang D Sangma, elder brother of arrested gang member Isreal Sangma.
Salgrang is currently on the run from authorities. He along with Lengdang are now known to have been the main conspirators of the group that was behind a series of abduction cases including the abduction of retired Tura Don Bosco School teacher G Sanyal from Zekabari area.
Sanyal was released only after the family reportedly paid a ransom to the group.
West Garo Hills police provided  a severe blow to the group by shooting dead two of its senior members in an encounter near Garobadha shortly after Sanyal was released from their  captivity."

486,Nokma’s son death: GNLA accuses Govt of delayed investigation,"Tuesday, July 28, 2015","TURA: The Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) has accused the State Government of deliberately delaying the investigation into the killing of the son of Oragitok Nokma, Sengbat Ch Marak some months ago in an alleged fake encounter.
“The police are trying to dodge accountability by saying they’re investigating but go weeks and months with no explanation to the family about the killing. And when at last they respond, it is simply to say, “We have found no wrong doing,” the statement issued by its Joint Publicity Secretary, Garo Mandei Ch Marak said.
Garo Mandei claimed that there were many cover ups into the investigation of the killing of Marak. He said that as many as 20 people had turned up at Rongram police outpost to give their statements but those were again twisted by the police.
He also raised the issue of police using surrendered militants for their operations. “It is a well known fact that police are not killing on their own. They are aided by surrendered cadres who offer themselves to provide the police with locations and ‘time to commit murder’,” he said.
Garo Mandei claimed that the ‘frustration expressed by the Home Minister was the inevitable result of one sidedness in defending the government and the police as well as an attempt to keep information  hidden from the public’.
He also cautioned those entrusted with the investigation to understand there was nothing that cannot be unearthed.
“You may defend the government for the while they are in power, but when this govt crumbles down you will suffer. The question is who in the government will bring about change?” he said."

Marak is pursuing the ST status case involving the Chief Minister which is scheduled to come up for hearing in the Supreme Court on July 31.
On July 22, the High Court of Meghalaya issued a notice to Tennydard in connection with the transfer of his pending case with the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate at Williamnagar to any other court. The same notice was also served to Social Welfare Minister Deborah Marak who preferred the matter to be tried in any other court than Williamnagar.
The issue of transfer of case is likely to come up in the High Court on July 30.
Sources said that though the High Court had issued the notice on July 22, a five-member police team went to the residence of Tennydard in East Garo Hills only on July 25 when he was not present.
According to the relatives, even though they wanted to receive the notice from the High Court, the police did not want to hand it over to them. Family sources said that sub inspector of Williamagar police station, FJ Sangma called up the wife of Tennydard, Mina Marak on Saturday, threatening that if her husband did not receive the notice from the Court he would be arrested.
Tennydard’s wife was ready to go to the Williamnagar police station to receive the notice since he was out of station, but the police did not want to hand it over to her.  Tennydard’s brother in- law, PG Momin too went to Williamnagar police station, but the letter was not given to him either.
It may be mentioned that both Deborah and Tennydard were charge sheeted by the police in November last year citing nexus with GNLA."

490,Borkhat: Retrieving history; rejuvenating the Myntdu,"Monday, July 27, 2015","SHILLONG: As a sequel to his documentary on the Jaintiapur route and Syndai Park, Jaintia Hills, SN Lamare, Associate Professor of History, NEHU presented his second documentary on Borkhat, known as the summer headquarters of the Jaintia Raja and for its ornate temple which is also known to have been the site for human sacrifice.
Prof Lamare and his team recorded this journey in 2009 with the single objective of capturing slices of history before time, nature and human activities erase them forever. The documentary claims to trace the integrated political and cultural history of the Jaintia people beyond the contingency of colonial cartography. It attempts to locate the colonial route between Jaintiapur, now in Bangladesh and Nartiang, the summer capital of the Jaintia Raja.
Through this documentary, Lamare, tries to weave an integrated account of the life of the Jaintia people living in the hills and the plains. In the process he also travels along the Myntdu river which is a vital communication link of commercial importance between Jaintiapur and Nartiang.
The Myntdu river, now a greenish hue in colour and leaving behind a thick residue of red sulphuric acid on the boulders and stones along its path is today a dead river. All marine life has been killed by the high acidic content of the river as a result of unscientific coal mining activities.
In the course of his conversation with the audience at Asian Confluence where the documentary was screened on Saturday, Prof Lamare said Jaintia Hills  used to be famous for the fish provided by the River Myntdu. The kha-syang or smoked fish was a delicacy that the Jaintia people were proud of. Today with most rivers poisoned by acid mine drainage (AMD) they have to depend on fish from Andhra Pradesh which is depleted of all nutrients.
The Myntdu river originates at Mihmyntdu, adjacent to Jowai town. It flows across Jowai, and then through Leshka (where the run of the river, hydro electric project is located) to reach Borkhat, before finally entering Bangladesh, where it is locally called the ‘Shari.’
Prof Lamare recorded his documentary much before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) could clamp down on coal mining in Meghalaya. This documentary in fact is a clear evidence of the destruction wrought by coal mining activities as it captures the foam like formation on the river which is perhaps triggered by some chemical reaction.
Although Lamare begins with the disclaimer that the documentary is strictly for creating awareness about the rapidly eroding evidence of past history, it managed to trigger a heated discussion about the extent of pollution of the Myntdu river which many in the audience have seen for the first time. Earlier they have only read about this strange phenomenon when shoals of dead fish would be floating on the river. Now the picturesque Myntdu is effectively dead. It would take a huge effort from the scientific community to rejuvenate this water body.
The documentary also captures interesting facets of the temple at Borkhat the interiors of which are exquisitely carved and bear testimony to the human sacrifice that took place inside.
Lamare’s efforts merit recognition as he is doing what few historians have cared to do -reclaiming history before it is lost forever. Will the agencies of the state step in to do their part? This is a question that the Heritage Sites listing committee of the Government should be engaging itself with."
491,Construction of State zoo at Ri-bhoi deferred yet again,"Monday, July 27, 2015","SHILLONG: The construction of State Zoo at the 75 hectare land at Umtrew village in Ri-Bhoi district has been temporarily postponed since the Forest and Environment department is currently preparing the plan estimates for construction of few cages to house the animals in the zoo.
“We are currently preparing the plan estimates for the construction of few of the cages to house the animals inside the zoo,” State Zoo Chief Executive Officer (CEO) P.H.S Bonney informed recently.
According to him, the Central Zoo has laid down stringent provisions for construction of these cages.
“We cannot construct the cages as per our own design. There are detailed specifications by the CZA on the width and height for construction of cages. The design of the cage varies from one animal to another,” Bonney who is also Chief Conservator of forest said.
After approval of plan estimates, he informed that the department would have to engage an architect to design the cage as per the CZA specifications.
“Not only this, the architect would also require to work closely with the CZA experts to design these cages. There cannot be a difference of even an inch on the measurement of the cage. In view of this, we will be taking all special precautions,” State Zoo CEO said.
He also informed that the construction of the cage will be taken up in a phase wise manner.
“We will take up construction of the cage as per the approval of funds. It is for this reason that the construction will be taken up in a phased manner,” Bonney said.
He also informed that the frequent change in the master plan has also led to the delay in zoo construction which is the first of its kind in the State.
According to him, there are numerous changes in the master plan in view of the design and also on the location of various zoo structures.
When asked about the actual ground position of the boundary fencing of the zoo, he said that almost 90 percent of the construction has been completed.
“The only portion which is left is the area which is near the construction of the four-laning road at Umsning by the NHAI. We will complete the fencing on this particular area once the construction of the four lane road is completed,” State Zoo CEO informed.
When asked about the tentative deadline of project completion, he said that it will be difficult to estimate the time limit as various components of the project are yet to be tackled.
“The completion of the project will also depend on the release of funds since the project is being jointly funded by the Centre, State Government and CZA,” Bonney informed.
It may be recalled that the concept paper of the project was prepared way back in 2002 while the master plan was prepared in 2005.
The construction of the State Zoo took off only in 2009. At the beginning, the total amount earmarked for the project was Rs 19 crore and the time of completion was three years from the day of commencement of the project.
“It is true that there are numerous delays in the implementation of the project due to different reasons. This delay has also led to cost escalation. It will be difficult to give any specific figures on funds which have been earmarked since the project is now being implemented in a phased manner,” he said.
The construction of the permanent zoo was felt necessary after the Supreme Court issued directive to the State Government to construct the zoo for housing the animals following the petition filed by the People for Ethical Treatment to Animals (PETA) which had questioned the lack of proper care and treatment to animals kept at the Lady Hydari Park in Shillong."

496,Farmers face ‘extortion’ at Bara Bazaar,"Monday, July 27, 2015","SHILLONG: The farmers from various parts of East Khasi Hills who bring vegetables for sale at Iewduh (Bara Bazaar) have to part with 1 kg for every 10 kg of weight, making it a deduction of 10 kg for every 100 kg.
A complaint was also made to CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing Rs. 50 is being charged for even a few minute stop to drop their vegetables at Mawlonghat.
In a statement issued to the media, CSWO said that in view of various complaints from farmers, the CSWO went to Iewduh on July 25 to check and verify and they were shocked to notice the daylight extortion.
“The vegetables of the farmers were weighed in weighing machines set up all over Iewduh vegetable wholesale market area. After weighing the vegetables, markers were put on them. The vegetables were then taken to the willing person.  Only a slip was given marking the weight and the farmer was paid only in the evening”, CSWO said.
According to CSWO, on every 10 kg, 1 kg was clearly slashed and for every 100 kg, 10 kg was deducted. “This badly affected the farmers as well as the public who had to buy vegetables at a much inflated rate”, the CSWO revealed.
The excuse from some agents was that the basket weighed about 5 kg which was deducted.  However, it was seen that even if they brought vegetable in a plastic sack which weighed hardly 250 grams, 10 per cent was still cut from the weight of the whole sack.
When CSWO asked the reason for such a late complaint, the farmers informed that they had complained about it many times earlier but it fell into deaf ears.
“We were also informed that there were some traders (wholesalers) who would not pay the agreed rate by evening and also reduce the price saying that the rate  had gone down”, CSWO informed.
Many tomatoes were left to rot and the farmers faced losses as they could not take them back to their village.
“There is a clear exploitation by these traders and the Syiem of Mylliem should immediately clamp down on such activities”, CSWO said, adding that the affected farmers should not allow the deduction and if such extortion continues the CSWO will file a complaint for extortion on their behalf.
According to CSWO, the State Government should arrange for alternatives so that such exploitation is not allowed and such traders should be stopped from taking advantage of illiterate farmers.
“Godowns should be arranged so that farmers can store their produce and the Syiem too should look into the well being of people by stopping these illegal traders from exploiting the farmers”, the CSWO said.
The CSWO also suggested that restaurants selling liquor all should be closed and land should not be given to land owners allowing this illegal trade. This land could in turn be used for building storage rooms for farmers.
The wholesalers should have the weighing done in their own godowns so that exploitation is stopped and no middlemen are involved, the CSWO added."

Earlier, there was opposition from many quarters to land allotment to the Air Force at Upper Shillong.
“In view of  RTI findings of KHNAM-Youth Wing, we are totally shocked over this proposal of the State Government to give land to the Defence Authorities in NST,” SNSSU general secretary Khrawbuit Ryntathiang told newsmen after visiting the proposed area on Saturday.
He also said that instead of giving land to the Defence Authorities, the State Government should instead ask them to return some of the land for expansion of roads in the city. “We fail to understand why the Government is considering their proposal especially when the Defence Authorities have got a huge chunk of land within Shillong itself which is unutilized,” SNSSU general secretary said.
Ryntathiang said that the people of the area will not allow Government to give this land to Defence especially after having a bitter experience with the station of BSF camp at Mawpat.
“The people are always in a state of fear in view of the presence of BSF in the area. We have also faced the problem of private land encroachment by BSF,” he said.
According to him, the presence of Indian Air Force (IAF) will pose another problem to the people of the area.
“We are already versed about the problem faced by the people of Upper Shillong due to harassment and encroachment by IAF. We will not want to see our people face similar hardships like the people of Upper Shillong,” Ryntathiang said. “We will garner support of Dorbar Shnong of the area to join us in this move to oppose this proposal of the Government,” SNSSU general secretary said."

When contacted, the Additional Chief Secretary in-charge, Municipal and Urban Affairs, P Naik said that the decision of switching over to the token system will be up to the people of the state."

The draft also states that adequate safe drinking water facilities should be provided to the entire population both in urban and rural areas.

“We understand that the bill has already gone to the Governor to get his assent. It is pointless to discuss on the issue at present,” he said.

“It is really sad that Meghalaya is only the State in the region which does not have its own bottling plant for refilling of LPG cylinders.

539,Govt told to study Umngot power project feasibility,"Friday, July 24, 2015","SHILLONG: The Central Electric Authority (CEA) has asked the State Government to conduct an extensive study on feasibility of Umngot hydro power project.
Speaking to The Shillong Times, the MeECL senior engineer Elias Lyngdoh said that the CEA has accepted the Techno Commercial Clearance (TEC) but wants MeECL to conduct an extensive study on the project.
The much-awaited and yet arguably the most controversial 240 mw Umngot hydro power project has cleared most of the hurdles. The detailed project report has been completed for the project.   The estimated budget of the project would be around Rs 1700 crore. However, it is feared that several swathes of agricultural land on the banks of the Umngot, which emanates from Smit village and flows to Bangladesh, could be inundated once the project takes off.
Reacting to a query about the land acquisition, Lyngdoh said that the land acquisition will follow later since there might be a change of site “if the CEA orders for it.”
Initially, the State government had approved the state-owned MeECL to execute the Umngot hydro electric project, estimated at a cost of Rs.1,853 crore in an area of 390 hectares straddling on both Jaintia Hills and East Khasi Hills districts.
Later, an empowered committee decided to hand over the project to the Jaypee Group stating MeECL will not be able to execute the project due to ‘various reasons’."

541,KHADC to preserve ‘Law Adong’ sans Hima consent,"Friday, July 24, 2015","SHILLONG: The KHADC have maintained that they are not going to accept the decision of the Hima Mylliem to scrap the agreement which was signed for declaring the lush pine plantation at “Law Syiem” at Lum Mawpat as “Law Adong” (reserve forest).
“We will go ahead to present the lush pine plantation which spread over a 1700 acres of land as “Law Adong” even without the consent of the Hima Mylliem. There is no question to backtrack from the agreement which was signed on May last year,” KHADC CEM Pynshngaiñ N Syiem told on Thursday.
He also said that the decision to sign the agreement was decided by both the KHADC and Hima Mylliem.
“Therefore, we will not allow the Hima Mylliem to take the decision when it comes to the Law Syiem. We expect the Hima Mylliem to take us into confidence while taking any kind of decision on this particular forest cover,” KHADC CEM said.
According to him, one of the clauses in the agreement has clearly stated that, both the KHADC and the Hima Mylliem shall jointly be responsible for regulation, management, maintenance and conservation of the ‘Law Adong’.
Syiem also informed that they have also received a letter from the office of Hima Mylliem which was signed by the Deputy Syiem, Thwelson Manik Syiem to the KHADC on July 14 urging the council to scrap the agreement.
”We will not allow that the agreement is scrap at any cost. We are very clear that the decision to convert the “Law Syiem” into “Law Adong” needs to be respected by both the parties,” he added.
The KHADC CEM also said that they have also replied to the letter of the Hima Mylliem by making its stand clear that it will not at any cost withdraw or scrap the agreement.
It may be mentioned that on May 22 last year, Mylliem Syiemship represented by the Syiem and the Myntris had entered into an agreement with the KHADC represented by the CEM and EM Forest to jointly manage the Pine Forest and convert it into a ‘Law Adong’ (Reserved Forest by which no one is allowed to touch the pine trees and other species including shrubs or cause wild fire).
Later, both the parties also declared the Mawpat forest as ‘Law Adong’ or ‘Reserve Forest’ on June 5, 2014, which coincides with the World Environment Day celebrations in the state.
While referring to the letter of the Hima Mylliem, the Executive Member in-charge Forest Grace Mary Kharpuri said that in the letter they  have stated that the reason behind the demand to scrap of the agreement was that they wanted to preserve the forest.“I failed to understand when the goal of both the parties is to preserve the forest then why they (Hima Mylliem) wanted to scrap the agreement.”She further informed that the district council has already sanction a fund of Rs 16 lakhs for construction of the proposed forest quarter at Lum Mawpat, the aim of which is to ensure that the forest is protected.They have also questioned the reason behind the letter being sent by the deputy Syiem inspite of the agreement being signed by the Syiem of Hima Mylliem."

571,‘Political affiliations weakened GHADC’,"Thursday, July 23, 2015","SHILLONG: Former ANVC-B leader Bernard Rimpu Marak on Wednesday called for de-politicizing the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council and threatened to lead a third front party to safeguard the interest of the people and to materialize the signed peace pact with the Government.
Alleging that there was a plan on the part of the Congress to re-capture the Council, Marak asserted that the GHADC was not supposed to face any anomaly in its functioning and execution of its duty, unlike what it is experiencing today.
“The architects of the ADCs had made sure that the Council would be an independent autonomous tribal institution. But the ADCs in general and the GHADC in particular have weakened since our elected MDCs have affiliated themselves to the ruling political parties in the State,” the former militant leader said.
He said that the State functionaries were parallel to the functionaries of the Council with defined parameters and the State could not control the Council, but through political affiliations, the Executive Members of the Council have made internal arrangements which led to handing over of many departments to the State Government including replacing town committees with municipality even in the Sixth Schedule area.
He pointed out that the GHADC was never meant to be under the State since the ADCs were constituted much before Meghalaya came into being as a State.
The former militant leader made the remarks in the context of reports that the GHADC staff had not been paid their salaries for the past five months."

SHILLONG: The mother of slain police officer PJ Marbaniang on Monday filed a petition before the High Court of Meghalaya seeking a CBI probe into the mysterious death of her son.
The matter was listed in the Division Bench to be taken up on Tuesday.
Marbaniang, who was serving as the officer in charge of Patharkhmah police outpost, Ri-Bhoi district was found dead in his official quarter on January 24 night with bullet injury on his head less than 24 hours after he detained 32 coal-laden trucks which were illegally transporting coal.
The Ri Bhoi police had initially termed it as a suicide case, but later registered it as a murder case.
Later, the discrepancies in the medical and post-mortem reports and the version of the doctor had compelled the Home department to set up a Special Investigation Team which, however, has not made much progress for the last 150 days since it has been waiting for forensic science laboratory reports.
The mother of the police officer Dorothy Marbaniang in her petition said that her son was right handed but from the FIR dated 27.1.2015 which was registered at Nongpoh, it transpired that the body was lying with his pistol on his left hand and “as such it creates reasonable doubt that he must have been murdered by someone”.
Moreover, the petitioner pointed out that the doctor of the Patharkhmah C.H.C revealed that the bullet entered from the back of his head and exited through his forehead.
The snapshot of the register of the C.H.C, and the medical examination report of the Senior Medical and Health Officer, in charge Patharkhmah CHC, Ri-Bhoi District, Meghalaya were enclosed with the petition
The petitioner said that that there was no immediate case registered in relation to the incident of January 24 and an FIR was filed and registered as unnatural death only on January 27.
The petitioner said that since SIT has failed in all aspects to investigate the matter and could not draw any  conclusion till date, the High Court should give the direction for handling over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation for justice.
According to the petitioner, there was no procedure  followed by the investigating agency as required under Section 174 Cr.P.C  in such cases ( information to executive magistrate) as the body of the offer  In-charge  was shifted from where it was lying to the nearest CHC Patharkhmah and then again to the GNRC, Guwahati.
Moreover, after releasing the body from GNRC Guwahati, it was brought back and was again taken to C.H.C Nongpoh for post mortem.
The Nongpoh CHC in the death certificate mentioned that the officer died at 8.50 P.M on January 24, 2015.
“However, a false certificate was again issued by the GNRC, Guwahati about my son’s date of death, that is, 25.01.2015″, the mother claimed.
According to the petitioner, her son died at 8.50 P.M on January 24, yet a drama was played as her son was taken to GNRC, Guwahati for reason best known to the investigating agency which has lead to “disturbing the crime scene and further led to destruction of evidence and has become fatal for the investigation of the case”."

However, Victoria’s   12-year-old daughter wanted to come back to Shillong and subsequently  on June 28, the mother of Victoria went to Hyderabad  to fetch the girl. The mother of Victoria along with the girl returned to Shillong on July 1.

He also criticized the Chief Minister for not attending the recent meeting of the NITI Aayog.

Lyngdoh further stated that the NGT ban on coal mining coupled with the leakages of revenue from various departments of the State has been depleting the coffers of the government by Rs.1200 crore annually.
“We are all aware that the present state of affairs is due to the NGT ban on coal mining which has affected the revenue of the State by over Rs.600 crores,” Lyngdoh said.
He also expressed concern over the fact that several public sector undertakings (PSUs) in the State were facing great difficulties in view of the financial crunch.
“We have seen that the staffs of the various PSUs are not getting even their salaries,” he said.

The request comes in the wake of the Dorbar of Hima Mylliem’s decision to scrap the agreement it had signed with the KHADC to declare Law Syiem as reserve forest.
“We strongly object to the decision of the Hima Mylliem to scrap the agreement signed with the KHADC,” Joint Committee of the Synjuk ki Dorbar Shnong president, JB Lyngdoh told newsmen after a meeting with Executive Member in-charge of Forest and Environment department, Grace Mary Kharpuri.

It may be mentioned that on May 22 last year, Mylliem Syiemship represented by the Syiem and the Myntris had entered into an agreement with the KHADC represented by the CEM and EM Forest to jointly manage the pine forest and convert it into a ‘Law Adong’.

SHILLONG: A mug with the printed photograph of young Scheffyner Kharkongor and her late mother Victoria Kharkongor has brought to the child’s mind the memories of her mother who was found dead under questionable circumstances at Dispur police station recently.
Scheffyner and the victim’s family want the truth to be revealed as they are unconvinced by the suicide theory of the Assam Police.
It’s been two weeks since Victoria’s custodial death at the washroom of Dispur police station on the night of July 5 and 12-year-old Scheffyner misses her mother more than ever.
It was when they were in Bangalore and when Scheffyner was just five years old that one of Victoria’s friends had gifted the special mug with the photo of the duo printed on it. Scheffyner and the family at Lawjynriew, Nongthymmai, have been holding on to the mug dearly as a memorial piece.
Scheffyner, who is studying in Class VI at the nearby Dinet Manik Syiem School, wants justice for her mother. Scheffyner, Victoria’s three sisters and the mother Belin Kharkongor reiterate that Victoria could not have committed suicide, even as they countered the claims of the Assam Police.
Victoria’s mother Belin has also expressed concern over the delay on the part of Assam Police in providing the inquest and post-mortem reports, report of the inquiry conducted by the Joint Commissioner of Police, CCTV footage from International Hospital, Dispur police station and Guwahati Railway Station on the evening of July 5. She had sought these reports from the Assam police on Monday last.
The mother is also not happy with the International Hospital for handing Victoria over to the police instead of counseling her. What happened at Dispur police station is also a mystery as police have failed to provide the CCTV footage of the police station even after Belin had written to the Commissioner of Police, Kamrup on Monday to provide the same within 48 hours.
Earlier, Assam Police had suspended Sub Inspectors, Pritilata Talukdar and Sanjib Kumar Chettri for bringing Victoria to the police station at night instead of taking her to a Government medical college  ) or hospital.    Assam Police, however, is yet to take action against the International Hospital for pushing Victoria into the hands of the police instead of addressing her concerns, the mother said.
It may be mentioned that the Assam Police had on Tuesday said that they had handed over the probe report into Victoria’s death to the Meghalaya Inspector General of Police. Belin, however, is yet to get any intimation from the Meghalaya police about the same.
“I want the state police to hand over a copy of the probe report to me,” Victoria’s mother said while maintaining that only a high level independent probe can bring out."

While local taxis are famous for refusing passengers, especially during rush hours, there are also many local taxi drivers whose behavior is unacceptable.
A person rued that he was getting late for dropping his son to school recently but rude taxi drivers refused to take the kid into the cab.
Local cabbies in the city are gradually turning into a menace, leaving the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) red-faced, openly flouting the rates fixed by the Transport Authority, harassing passengers and resorting to blatant ‘looting’ in the name of taxi fares.
Speaking on the menace of local cabbies, East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner PS Dkhar said that District Administration has some plans to deal with the menace but refused to divulge the same.
It may be noted that drivers in the city are not charging fares as per the given rates. Instead they charge a plain rate of Rs 10 and Rs 20.
Though many intellectuals have opined that the taxi drivers should display the fare charges but the District Administration so far has not taken any step in this regard.
While most of the drivers are well behaved, the behavior of some is highly questionable.
Shillong police often asks people to come forward and lodge complaint against over-charging or over loading by local cabbies. It has been observed that since the Government introduced its public transport, the high handedness of the local taxi drivers has doubled."

634,Woman dies of alleged torture,"Monday, July 20, 2015","SHILLONG: After a woman identified as Madhavi Dey died of alleged torture and harassment by her husband Rupak Dey and mother in law at Oakland here, police arrested the husband on Saturday, but the needle of suspicion is on her mother-in law.
Police sources said that after the FIR was lodged by the relatives of the deceased, they interrogated the husband of the victim and subsequently arrested him, though he has not admitted to the crime. Police will also interrogate the mother to complete the investigation.
After the incident, Haran Paul of Rupnagar, Assam lodged a complaint that on July 11, he received a phone call from his brother-in-law informing that the complainant’s sister had expired in Shillong. However, on reaching Shillong he found that his sister was subjected to physical and mental torture by her husband and mother-in-law.
Family sources of the deceased from Assam said that she complained them about the physical and mental torture by her mother in law over petty issues.
Sources close to the family of the deceased said as there was no demand for dowry, they failed to understand the mysterious circumstances which led to her death. They demanded justice into the untimely and unnatural death of the woman and urged police to punish the culprit.
The allegations are that the woman came under the attack of the husband-mother- in- law duo frequently and they even used sharp and blunt objects to target her.
While there are allegations that the mother in law used a grinding kitchen tool made of stone to hit the head of the daughter-in-law resulting in her death, police said that the mother-in-law, who is aged will be interrogated as they are also looking into this angle.
Earlier, the family of the deceased was informed over phone by her husband that she died of stroke at around 2:30 am on July 10.
It is learnt that the woman and her husband were happily married for the last 11/12 years and have a school going girl child.  Interestingly, on the fateful day it is alleged that the girl child of the deceased was sent to her husband’s sister’s place.
The relationship between the husband and wife turned sour in recent times and it was alleged that it was all due to the interference of the mother-in-law.
Familiar sources said that the deceased on the fateful day visited one of her friends and told her that she was not feeling well."

640,GHADC polls: Govt undecided,"Sunday, July 19, 2015","SHILLONG: With just a month remaining for the expiry of the extended tenure of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC), the State Government is yet to decide on the date for holding fresh elections to the Council.
Time is running short for the Government as the term of the present Council is set to expire on August 17.
It was in January this year that the State Government had decided to extend the tenure of the Council for the third consecutive time for six months with effect from February 17.
District Council Affairs Minister H.D.R. Lyngdoh had recently said that the election would     be held prior to the end of the extended term of the GHADC, but did not reveal the exact date for polls.
Though elections to the KHADC and the JHADC were conducted last year, the State Government has been delaying the GHADC elections from February last year with an explanation that it was waiting for the Parliament to amend the Constitution to increase the seats in the GHADC from the current 30 to 40, but in vain.
During a meeting of senior State government officials and ANVC & ANVC-B leaders with officials of the Union Home Ministry in May this year, the State Government was told by the Home Ministry officials that holding of GHADC elections had nothing to do with amendment of the Constitution.
In this context, in a late realization, a State Cabinet meeting held on June 10 made it clear that the Government will not wait for the amendment of the Constitution and would instead go ahead with holding elections.
An official source said on Saturday that the deputy commissioners of all the five districts of Garo Hills had given their feedback on their preparedness to hold the GHADC election.
The deputy commissioners have already updated the electoral rolls and rationalized the constituencies to pave way for holding the election at any time."
641,Insurgency blocking GH development,"Sunday, July 19, 2015","SHILLONG: Due to the spurt in militant activities including abductions and extortion in Garo Hills, many officers from outside Garo Hills have expressed their unwillingness to serve there, thereby affecting development of the backward region.
Source said that many Government offices located in Garo Hills continue to receive demand notes and the targets are the government officials from outside Garo Hills who are serving there.
According to sources, while many officers are reluctantly serving in Garo Hills, some others have already sought transfers to be posted outside Garo Hills.
Militant groups send the demand for money via text messages to the mobile phones of the officers and at times they directly call the officers over phone seeking money.
The latest victim of kidnapping is P.K. Sharma, District Sports Officer from Kherapara, West Garo Hills.
Police are suspecting the role of GNLA militants behind the adduction of the sports official even as the police have received information that the militants are demanding ransom of several lakhs of rupees for his release.
Despite the recent killing of GNLA leader Savio Marak and the surrender of many cadres of various militant outfits, the law and order situation in Garo Hills is yet to improve.
A Home department official has admitted that Garo Hills remains an area of concern in terms of general law and order due to the presence of splinter groups which have broken away from the bigger militant groups in Garo Hills.
Besides series of abductions, extortions and killings have become the order of the day in Garo Hills.
A police official said that the Government officials who get demand notes should lodge complaint with the police promptly so that action can be initiated.
However, many do not prefer to inform the police for fear of repercussion from the militants."
642,Govt examining High Court order,"Sunday, July 19, 2015","HC bars State from issuing mining licenses without Central clearance
SHILLONG: The Law department is examining the recent order of the High Court of Meghalaya asking the State government to get the clearance of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) before granting license to any company to extract minerals.
The June 30 order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Meghalaya said that “except in cases where license for extraction of minerals has already been granted or lease deed for that purpose has already been entered into in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court, all other mining activities shall have to stop and in future the State shall not grant any license or enter into a lease deed for extraction of minerals without consultation with the CEC; drawing a comprehensive scheme; and creating a fund for reclamation in the interest of sustainable development and intergenerational equity, and for the purpose of rectifying the damage caused to the forest and environment”.
An official from the Forest and Environment department said on Saturday the Law department was examining the implications of the order.
There are indications that the State Government may approach the Supreme Court to get redress.
However, the official source said that before taking any decision, the matter will have to be examined by the Law department.
“The High Court refers only to the future agreement with companies for extraction of minerals and this is being examined by legal experts,” the source added.
The High Court in the order said that the Central Empowered Committee has been constituted by the Supreme Court with all India jurisdiction and for extraction of mines from the forest land of any kind, it is mandatory to take clearance under Forest (Conservation) Act.
“The State is only the guardian and trustee of natural resources and the people of the country are the owners. Thus, the State Government cannot grant lease for extracting minerals in the State of Meghalaya without meeting the aforesaid requirements, and the Autonomous District Councils have no power to collect compensatory fee thereon which may encourage illegal mining activities and which can also be investigated into by the Central Bureau of Investigation as directed by the Supreme Court in T.N. Godavarman’s case,” the Court said.
The High Court further said that in order to reclaim the damage caused to the forest and the environment, as a result of mining activities, even if permitted under the rules, shall have to draw a comprehensive scheme and create a fund for reclamation an amount to the extent of not less than 10 per cent of the sale proceeds of the minerals extracted under the license or lease deed as provided in the judgment of the Supreme Court in accordance with the principle that a ‘polluter shall pay’.
No role for District Councils
The High Court has also made it clear that only the State Government and not the Autonomous District Councils which can impose and collect the fee in respect of damage to forest by extraction and transportation of minerals like coal, limestone and others."

645,Sohra Marathon organizers slammed for causing ‘inconvenience’ to commuters,"Sunday, July 19, 2015","SHILLONG: A day after the successful completion of the Sohra Marathon, some organizations have slammed the grand event accusing that it caused major inconvenience to the people of the area.
“The organizers of the marathon decided to close down the road without publicizing it. The public came to know of the decision only in the morning when they saw the “No Entry” board,” Federation of Khasi Jaiñtia and Garo People (FKJGP) Sohra circle president, RL Nongrum told newsmen here on Saturday.
According to him, thousands were left stranded for several hours on account of the closure of the road from 6 am to 12 noon.
Informing that hundreds of vehicles which were heading towards Shillong were stuck at Sohra and those from Shillong remained halted at Mawkdok, Nongrum said that the people were under the impression that the vehicles would be allowed to use one side of the road.
He, however, made it very clear that they are not against the marathon.
“But we expect the organizers to widely publicise before closing down the road,” the FKJGP Sohra Circle president said.
Meanwhile, Synjuk Seng Samla Shnong Sohra (SSSS) chairman, B Mylliemngap stated though the second edition of the Sohra Marathon has been a success for the organizers, people of the area have turned out to be the biggest losers in the event.
He also questioned the alleged failure of the organizers to arrange a pick up for participants from Sohra.
“It was really sad since the participants from Sohra were waiting for the vehicle since 5 AM. It was in the very last minute that the organizers informed that they would not be able to send the vehicle for picking up the participants,” Mylliemngap said adding that the SSSS had to arrange for the transportation to drop the participants at Mawkdok, the starting point of the marathon.
“But when they reached there, the full marathon had already been flagged off,” he added."

649,Agitating Gram Sevikas fighting a lost battle: Tynsong,"Sunday, July 19, 2015","SHILLONG: Community and Rural Development (C&RD) Minister, Prestone Tynsong said he was not against the extension of the validity of the merit list of the qualified candidates for the post of Gram Sevika but was apprehensive as to how the department will absorb all the agitating candidates.
“I will be more than happy if the validity of the merit list is extended but the decision to extend the validity lies with the Personnel department,” Tynsong stated here on Saturday.
Tynsong added that though he sympathized with the agitating candidates, it was impossible for the department to absorb all the agitating candidates since there are only ten posts of Gram Sevika in entire East Khasi Hills.
“Where will department absorb all of them especially with ten of the qualified candidates still to be given appointment. It is impossible for the department to absorb everyone since there are only ten posts of Gram Sevika in the whole of East Khasi Hills,” he said.
He added that the Government cannot continue to extend the validity of the merit list since “it is illegal”.
“Therefore, I personally feel that the young women are fighting a lost battle,” Tynsong said.
The Community and Rural Development (C&RD) Minister informed that when the District Selection Committee (DSC) declared the merit list in 2012, a total number of 12 women candidates featured in the list.
“At that point of time, only two posts of Gram Sevika were vacant. Therefore, immediately after the announcement of the result, the department gave appointment to two of the candidates who were in the top of the merit list,” Tynsong said.
He added that the one year validity of the merit list ended in August 2013.
Tynsong informed that at present there were only two vacant posts for the Gram Sevikas, one at Laitkroh Community and Rural Development (C&RD) office and the other at Pynursla C&RD office.”If the Government extends the validity of the merit list to fill up the two vacant posts what is the assurance that the women will not hold another hunger strike for securing appointments in the future,” Tynsong stated.
The C&RD Minister admitted that the DSC made a mistake in declaring the list of qualified candidates which is over 100 times the vacant posts.
“We had bitter experience with the Grade IV candidates with over 333 candidates featuring in the merit. Therefore, we have directed the various DSC to come up with a list of qualified candidates as per the number of posts available,” Tynsong said.
Meanwhile, the Qualified Candidates for the post of Gram Sevika 2012, East Khasi Hills continued their indefinite hunger strike on Saturday. Earlier, East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner Peter S Dkhar had informed that he would send a fresh reminder to the State Government for the extension of the merit list of the qualified candidates for the post of Gram Sevika."

SHILLONG: Pro-ILP groups, which has been demanding implementation of a “comprehensive mechanism” to combat and regulate influx into Meghalaya, have threatened to walk out of the ‘agreement’ they had with the state government if the latter fail to speed up the process.
“We will like to see that the State Government expedites the whole process at the earliest. We cannot wait anymore,” KSU president Daniel Khyriem said.
On April 29, the groups had submitted their suggestions to the government on the need to implement a comprehensive mechanism to combat and regulate influx into the state in line with the spirit of the Eastern Bengal Frontier Regulation Act, 1873.
However, the government has not been able to implement the proposed comprehensive mechanism, which includes setting up of exit and entry points in various parts of the state.
He said that the Government had been dilly-dallying the implementation of the mechanisms suggested by them.
Khyriem said this while speaking at a function organized  to unveil the statue of freedom fighter U Tirot Sing at Madan Iewrynghep, Laitumkhrah on Friday.
According to him, as the first phase of the mechanisms, the government was supposed to set up three entry-exit points at Byrnihat (Ri-Bhoi), Ratacherra (East Jaiñtia Hills) and Rani (West Khasi Hills).
“The Deputy Commissioner’s office has acquired land and even survey has been completed in this connection,” he said adding that in Ratacherra the land has been given free of cost.

653,State Cabinet decision on voting right stuns CEO,"Saturday, July 18, 2015","SHILLONG: The curious July 10 decision of the Meghalaya cabinet to allow the citizens to vote only in their places of origin and not where they reside temporarily has evoked reactions.
When contacted to know the feedback on the decision of the cabinet from the Election Commission of India, the Additional Chief Secretary in-charge Election P Naik said that the matter relates to the Representation of People’s Act passed by the Parliament and the Election Commission of India was only implementing it.
According to Naik, who is also the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), any change in the present Representation of People’s Act needs to be done only by the Parliament.
Meanwhile sources said that the cabinet decision goes against the Representation of People’s Act.
As per the Act, any ordinary resident of a place can cast his votes and the decision of the Cabinet to ask the citizens to vote only in their places of origin goes against the spirit of the Act as well the Constitution .
According to sources, the citizens  of the state can contest anywhere in the state in Assembly polls and as far as Lok Sabha polls are concerned, a citizen can contest anywhere in the country except in the reserved seats. A case in point is the election of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh from Assam to Rajya Sabha whereas Singh is not residing in Assam, sources added.
The Cabinet during its meeting on July 10 referred to the notification of the Election Commission of India which said, “whoever is a temporary resident should be enumerated as voter”, which, according to the Government will bring mistrust in the state especially between the local population and migrants."
654,State police give contradictory versions,"Saturday, July 18, 2015","Mysterious case of miscreants taking away pistol from cop
SHILLONG: Mystery surrounds miscreants snatching away a 9mm pistol from a constable of 6th MLP who in fact was carrying the weapon of his higher up, Assistant Commandant, 6th MLP.
As per the first FIR lodged by police, on July 14 at around 10.30 pm, two unidentified occupants of a local taxi (number unknown) stopped the vehicle of BNC/959 Disken Nongrum of 6th MLP Bn at 101 Area, Upper Shillong, hit him with a hammer and snatched away “his 9mm service pistol” along with 12 rounds of ammunition. The victim chased the assailants in his vehicle and overtook them at Mawlai, Nongkwar near M/s Banalari World Cars, but he was again assaulted. The victim managed to reach his residence at Mawiong, and was later taken to Civil Hospital.
However, another FIR lodged on July 14 by the Assistant  Commandant, 6th MLP Bn  E. Marap said that  that on July 7at around 10 pm, he handed over his 9mm Browning Pistol to his gunman BNC Diskansing Nongrum and went to Kamrup, Assam to attend  a court hearing.
According to the FIR, on July 14 at around 10 pm, while the constable Nongrum was travelling in a Maruti car (ML-06-3978) it collided with a local taxi (number not known) at 101 Area, Upper Shillong. Following this incident, the unidentified occupants of the local taxi assaulted him with lethal objects and snatched away the service pistol.
Questions are doing the rounds as to how the Assistant Commandant, 6th MLP can hand over his personal weapon to his gunman. Moreover, the gunman kept the pistol of his higher up for almost a week.
Another claim of the gunman is that he does not know the number of the vehicle of his assailants though he had chased them in his vehicle and overtook them at Mawlai, Nongkwar near M/s Banalari World Cars. Moreover, the assailants who came in the local taxi had first stopped the gunman at 101 Area, Upper Shillong, but he did not specify the number plate of the vehicle in the FIR and it was mentioned as unknown.
Sources said that there should be a proper inquiry by the police questioning both the Assistant Commandant, 6th MLP Bn  and his gunman to find out the truth as there is mystery over the version of both.
An official source said that nobody below the rank of sub inspector is allowed to use 9 mm pistol.
In this context handing over one’s personal service weapon to the sub ordinate is careless attitude on the part of the Assistant Commandant, sources added.
When contacted, East Khasi Hills SP M Kharkrang said that no one has been arrested so far in this connection and even the vehicle where the assailants came had not been identified."
655,MUDA’s parking lot plan faces land hurdle,"Saturday, July 18, 2015","Scarce parking space adds to city’s traffic woes
SHILLONG: If pushing one’s way through the heavy traffic in the city is a cumbersome task, finding a place to park the vehicle is a job more herculean. With parking lots few and far between, the Shillongite is left stranded, looking desperately for a vacant slot to place the vehicle.
Though the Urban Affairs department intends to add to the number of parking lots in the city, non-cooperation on the part of the people in parting with their land acts as a stumbling block to the entire initiative.
Sources from the Urban Affairs department said that the department has identified some places to construct parking lots and even detailed project reports have been prepared for the same. However, people are unwilling to part with the land.
Be it the commercial areas of the city or the localities, finding a place to park a vehicle is by no means easy.  One of the major factors which add to traffic congestion in the city is the fact that most commercial buildings in Shillong are devoid of parking facilities. The problem is not restricted to commercial buildings built years ago but even the recent ones.
In Khyndailad (Police Bazar) for instance, it is difficult to find a place to park even a two-wheeler. For four wheelers, the MUDA parking lot is the only option.
The larger problem faced by the city is the inability of the four existing parking lots to accommodate the growing number of vehicles and under the circumstances, cooperation between the State and the common public is a must to negate the existing traffic menace."

657,Life-size statue of U Tirot Sing unveiled in city,"Saturday, July 18, 2015","SHILLONG: A life-size of Khasi freedom fighter U Tirot Sing Syiem was unveiled here on Friday, thanks to the efforts of the Khasi Students’ Union, which had taken upon itself the mantle of installing the statue of the legendary freedom fighter.
This is the KSU’s second such effort, the first being the installation of the statue of U Kiang Nangbah at the rotary opposition Shillong Civil Hospital.
The statue of U Tirot Sing was installed near Madan Iewrynghep, Laitumkhrah, on Friday by journalist
Sumar Sing Sawian to commemorate the 180th death anniversary of the legendary warrior. The statue was carved by a local artist from Nongrah, Seibor Kharmawphlang.
The union said it had installed these life size statues with the aim of making Khasi and Jaintia youths aware of their own freedom fighters and other historical figures so that they could look up to them as their icons.
Speaking on the occasion, NESO chairman Samuel B Jyrwa said that the indigenous Khasi-Jaintia community has not produced many great leaders whom people can look up to.
“It is for this reason that many of indigenous youths of the present era are looking up to people from outside the community as their icons and heroes,” Jyrwa said.
He pointed out that the problems being faced by the indigenous people today are the same as compared to the era of U Tirot Sing.
“The Syiem of Nongkhlaw had fought 180 years ago against the British. Now we are fighting against illegal immigration which is trying to get a foothold over our businesses and land,” the NESO chairman said.
He recalled that during the time of U Tirot Sing, the British rulers had wanted to construct a road through the Khasi Hills by making false promises.
“Now, the Government of India is constructing roads for mining of uranium. But in the name of development they are fooling our people by construing roads in West Khasi Hills and South West Hills. This thinking of the Indian Government is no different than that of the British during pre-Independence,” Jyrwa stated.
Former KSU chief Danny Khyriem lamented the fact that school students did not know about the freedom fighters and historical figures of the State as they were not included in the syllabi.
Khyriem also suggested that the KSU should take upon itself the mantle of educating the younger generation that ‘the Khasis are a martial race’.
The KSU Girls’ Wing, the first of its kind, was constituted on the same day. Around 70 girls drawn from all over the State and neighbouring Assam were inducted into the union with the oath being administered by KSU president Daniel Khyriem."

Higher Secondary School in Williamnagar.
In its complaint submitted to the Director of School Education and Literacy in Shillong the organisations claimed that one, Dina Maya Sharma, an outsider was appointed as a Hindi teacher in the said school by the Joint Director of School, Education and Literacy, East Garo Hills in total violation of the appointment policy of the State Government.
They claimed that an appointment order was issued to Sharma without advertising for   the vacant post thereby depriving other aspiring candidates of an opportunity to be appointed.
Citing another breach of the appointment rules the organisations claimed that another Hindi teacher, Amit Kumar Jha who was appointed on an ad hoc basis was being given additional privileges as compared to other teachers in the same category.
“It is mandatory that teachers appointed on ad hoc basis for 59 days have to renew their appointment after a gap of two days. If all the other teachers are applying for renewal periodically, why is Amit Kumar Jha exempted from this specific rule? How can the rule be different for people serving in the same post in the same establishment under the same category” they questioned.
Expressing strong objection to the anomalies in the school they have demanded that the appointment order issued to Dina Maya Sharma is immediately revoked, that an advertisement for a vacant post is published in newspapers to offer equal opportunities for all and that Amit Kumar Jha is made to apply for renewal after 59 like all the other teachers of his category.
“All incumbents must be uniformly exempted or subjected to whatever rules the establishment may deem fit to adopt and implement. The reservation policy of the Government of Meghalaya must not be forgotten in the recruitment process,” they added."
667,High Court sets aside Govt order on CMJU dissolution,"Friday, July 17, 2015","SHILLONG: The High Court of Meghalaya has set aside the dissolution order of CMJ University by the State Government.
Advocate R. Jha, who appeared on behalf of CMJ University in the Court, confirmed on Thursday that the High Court had set aside the order of the State Government to dissolve the University.
It was on March 31 last year that the State Education department had ordered dissolution of the CMJ University.
In the aftermath of the recommendation of former Meghalaya Governor R.S. Mooshahary, as Visitor of the University, on June 12, 2013 for dissolution of CMJ University as per Section 48 of the CMJ University Act, 2009, the State Government had issued show-cause notice to the University.
The Education department, after getting the reply from CMJ University, found the reply to the show-cause notice as not satisfactory resulting in the dissolution of the University.
Section 48 of the CMJ University Act, 2009, highlights that “upon identification of mismanagement and mal-administration, the State Government would issue directions for rectification to the University. If the directions are not followed, the State Government can take steps to wind up the University”.
Earlier, the Meghalaya Private University Regulatory Board had also recommended dissolution of CMJ University.
The State Government dissolved the University based on Section 48 of the CMJ University Act, 2009 and also following the observation of the then Governor, who had pointed out that from established facts, “it was clear that there has been mismanagement, mal-administration, indiscipline and failure in the accomplishment of the objectives of the University, apart from criminal liability”.
The High Court Judge T. Nandakumar Singh after hearing both parties, in the order on Thursday, said, “This Court is of the considered view that there was non-compliance with or breach of the fundamental procedural requirements as provided under Section 48 of the said Act of 2009 as well as principles of natural justice and the concept of the obligation of the administrative authorities to act fairly in issuing the show cause notices dated 12.11.2013 and 24.01.2014 and passing the impugned order dated 31.03.2014 which would lead to many facets injustice. Thus, the impugned order dated 31.03.2014 and the show cause notices dated 12.11.2013 and 24.01.2014 are hereby quashed and set aside”.
The Judge, however, said in the order that the State Government may take steps in strict compliance with the provisions of the CMJ University Act, 2009 (Act 4 of 2009), the Meghalaya Private Universities (Regulation of Establishment and Maintenance of Standards) Act, 2012 (Act No.8 of 2012), principles of natural justice and the concept of the obligation of the administrative authorities to act fairly in interest of justice from the stage where the Apex Court passed the judgment and order dated September 13, 2013.
The Supreme Court in its order on September 13 had directed the State Government to take an appropriate action under Section 48 of the Act of 2009 after giving notice and reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioners.
According to the High Court, the State respondents in compliance of the mandatory requirement under Section 48 (2) of the Act of 2009, did not issue any direction to the petitioners to follow after identification of mismanagement, mal administration, in-discipline, failure in accomplishment of the objectives of the University and economic hardships in the management of the University.
The High Court also observed it was not the Visitor of the University who should issue direction regarding mismanagement of the University, but the State Government."

After receiving a letter from the Ministry, the State Government had written to the Council with the request for handing over of the land from Wahkaji to Mawthabah which was funded by the UCIL.
Sources on Thursday revealed that the previous KHADC Executive Committee headed by ARPA had kept the matter pending since they did not want to take any decision in this regard in the wake of opposition to uranium mining in South West Khasi Hills.
“The previous EC had refrained from taking any decision since there were growing speculations that the road construction was funded by UCIL to facilitate uranium mining in the State,” sources said.
According to sources, the present Executive Committee is yet to have a discussion on the matter.
“The file is lying with Chief Executive Member Pynshngain N Syiem,” the sources added.
Earlier, the Ministry had sanctioned construction of the Nongstoin-Domiasiat-Mawthabah road, a distance of 68 km, at a cost of Rs.470 crore.
Former Executive Member in charge Mining and Geology department Donkupar Sumer had stated that they had decided to wait for the response from the UCIL since the project was yet to be completed.
“If the UCIL does not have any issue in allowing the Ministry to complete the road project then we have no problem to hand over the land,” Sumer said here on Tuesday, while adding that they have already written to the UCIL seeking their response.
“We will take a final call as soon as we get the response from UCIL,” Sumer stated.
Interestingly, sources informed that the UCIL had already given its green signal to hand over the road project to the Ministry but the KHADC was delaying the matter.
Out of the 20 km of road constructed, sources revealed that around 13.5 km was yet to be black topped since the UCIL was yet to release the full amount of the fund allocated for the project.
Sumer informed that UCIL had released a total amount of Rs.32 crore till May last year but had stopped further release of funds since then."

Nongbri, member secretary of the committee, while explaining the need for additional time, said the committee was yet to get details from the Census department on the number of Khasi-speaking citizens in Meghalaya as per the 2011 Census. She added that the data has to be substantiated by the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Census.  Stating that qualitative data was required from the National Register of Citizens, Commissioner of Education, E.P. Kharbhih, said the NRC report was not an option since the process had not begun in Meghalaya.
“Any opposition to NRC will be a stumbling block to our intention since the Union Government relies on NRC, he said during the media briefing after the meeting.
As per the Constitution, for a language to be included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution, it must be spoken by at least five lakh people.
Other members of the committee pointed out that Manipuri language was given due recognition and was included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution in 1992 even though the demand had been made a long time ago. “Meghalaya has just started its ground work into the demand for inclusion of Khasi language in the Eighth Schedule,” they added."

According to the Division Bench of the Court, “The inspection reports of the officer thus appear to be evasive. In view of the matter, we direct the Secretary, Telecommunication, to file his personal affidavit. The State Government through the Department of Health shall also conduct a survey to find out the adverse impact if any, on the health, of the people of the localities situated near the towers in question as a result of     radiation emitted by the mobile towers”.

716,GNLA remains intact despite reverses: Police,"Wednesday, July 15, 2015","SHILLONG: Despite facing recurring reverses, the GNLA remains intact and can still be considered a potent force to reckon with considering their fire power, Meghalaya police sources said on Tuesday.
The sources said that the GNLA might have suffered a lot but police is not underestimating the might of the outfit and would continue with their all out offensive against the outfit to neutralize it.
The GNLA recently suffered a major blow when its senior leader Savio Marak was allegedly killed in an encounter with East Garo Hills Police.
Adding to the woes of the militant outfit is the fact that dozens of its cadres have laid down arms before the police in the last couple of months.
The police sources, however, refused to admit that Savio’s death would be a demoralizer for the outfit, and instead claimed that police cannot underestimate any militant outfit operating in Meghalaya.
As per police assessment, the GNLA has an effective strength of around 150 cadres and an almost equal number of over ground workers and sympathizers.
The GNLA was formed almost four years back to fight for a separate Garo state but over the years the outfit has unleashed a reign of terror in Garo Hills region leading to countless killings and abductions and extortions becoming the order of the day in the trouble-torn region."
717,Pollution still rampant on Wahumkhrah,"Wednesday, July 15, 2015","SHILLONG: From time to time environmentalists, NGOs and political masters have continued to raise the issue of pollution on the Wahumkhrah River but despite all talks, the river continues to flow in the same filthy condition.
It is evident that the situation in the river has not improved even one bit as the river has literally turned into a drain owing to continuous encroachment and pollution.
Taking cognizance of the alarming pollution on the river, city-based environmentalist Naba Bhattacharjee had filed a plea before the National Green Tribunal following which the NGT ordered removal of all illegal structures along the Wahumkhrah within three months.
Based on the NGT directives, the Urban Affairs department issued notices to the owners of as many as 300 such structures.
The Meghalaya Urban Development Authority (MUDA) received as many as 200 responses from residents living along the Wahumkhrah River following the NGT order for removal of illegal structures along the river.
The next hearing on the case is slated for July 23.
It is noteworthy that the State Water Resources department had prepared a Rs.50 crore Detailed Project Report (DPR) for flood management programme for the protection of Wahumkhrah and Umshyrpi rivers but the project is yet to be cleared by the Union Government.
The programme, aimed at tackling floods caused by the two rivers especially during the monsoon season, also aims at creating awareness among the public on the need to preserve and protect the two rivers."

NPP spokesperson James Sangma on Tuesday said there was an apparent lack of concern on the part of the Meghalaya Government to draft and submit the guidelines in the form of the Mining Plan to the NGT.
“This is despite the directive of the NGT instructing it to submit the Mining Plan within a stipulated time,” Sangma said.
According to the NPP, the party was concerned over the fact that the Congress Government seemed to be deliberately delaying the submission of the Mining Plan for reasons best known to them.
“This simple process should not have taken more than three months,” Sangma claimed, adding that the party fails to understand the apathy on the part of Government given the economic crisis that the State was going through considering the huge loss in revenue due to the ban on coal mining."
722,WJH Dorbar Shnong denies assault charges against villagers,"Wednesday, July 15, 2015","SHILLONG: The Dorbar Shnong of Barato village in West Jaintia Hills District has denied reports that residents of the village were responsible for the attack on the Rangbah Shnong of neighbouring Maitdein village, on the night of July 6.
“It was surprising that the Rangbah Shnong, Da Arphi Sariang, had alleged that people of Barato village were responsible for the attack as reported in the media,” Barato village secretary Harvest Shadap told newsmen here on Tuesday.
Pointing out that the alleged victim had claimed that around 15 to 20 persons from Barato had assaulted him, Shadap questioned why the    Rangbah Shnong had mentioned the names of only five of the accused in his complaint to police.
Shadap also questioned the complainant’s motive behind naming Barato Rangbah Shnong Madal Suchiang and other members of the Dorbar executive committee in his FIR, saying, “It is impossible that they were involved in the assault since they were attending a joint meeting of the executive committee on the night when the Rangbah Shnong of Maitdein village was allegedly assaulted.”
The Barato village secretary indicated that they were planning to file a defamation case against Sariang.
“We also warn him not to make such wild allegations,” Shadap said.
Shadap also drew the press’ attention to the long history of land dispute between the two villages.
“The two villages have been engaged in a cold war for the past many decades due to the land problem,” the Barato village secretary claimed.
According to him, the latest problem between two villages arose after residents of Barato village on April 27 last went to erect boundary pillars within the village jurisdiction up to Myntang River as per land documents and records available with them.
“This decision to erect the boundary pillar had not gone down well with residents of the neighboring villages. The Rangbah Shnong of Maitdein had even accused the people of Barato village of trying to destroy their paddy fields,” Shadap claimed, while adding that the West Jaintia Hills district administration and even the JHADC had tried to intervene to resolve the growing differences between the two villages, but to no avail."

The association had, in April, given a deadline after the State Government failed to respond to their demand to extend the validity of their merit list which ended on August 21, 2013.
As per the RTI filed by the qualified candidates, there are three vacant posts of Gram Sevikas – two at Laitkroh Block Development Office and one at Pynursla Block Development Office.
Out of the 12 qualified candidates in the merit list, only two have been given appointments so far.
“We have decided to continue with the hunger strike until the State Government decides to extend the validity of the merit list,” one of the qualified candidates, Bisylda Jyrwa, said.
She also informed that they had written several letters to the Government for extension of the validity of the merit list since the beginning of 2013, but to no avail.
Jyrwa also informed that the Government had even rejected the recommendations of the District Selection Committee (DSC) to extend the validity of the merit list.
Reacting to the indefinite hunger strike, Nongthymmai legislator Jemino Mawthoh said it was a grave injustice to these young women who have been denied appointment even after clearing the selection test conducted by the DSC.
“The DSC should have come up with a merit list as per the number of vacant posts. This is a glaring error on the part of the selection committee to have given false hope to these young women,” Mawthoh said.
He observed that the Government should consider the case of the qualified candidates akin to what it had done in the case of the Grade IV candidates.
Mawthoh also informed that he had taken up the issue with Chief Secretary Barkos Warjri.
Meanwhile, TUR expressed solidarity with the agitating candidates and said that the women need to be given their due given that the RTI findings revealed that there have been illegal ad hoc and temporary appointments.
“We would like to urge upon the State Women’s Commission to take up this case on a priority basis,” TUR said on Monday."

739,Distribution of power under VAB opposed,"Tuesday, July 14, 2015","Federation of Khasi States resents idea of Village Development Council
SHILLONG: The Federation of Khasi States (FKS) has taken strong exception to certain clauses in the KHAD (Village Administration) Bill which paves for creation of two powers centres in various localities and villages within the jurisdiction of the KHADC.
“Constitution of the two powers centers will have a negative impact on the prevailing customary practices of the indigenous Khasi population,” Advisor, Federation of Khasi States, Laborious Manik Syiem told newsmen after meeting KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem here on Monday.
Referring to Clause 13 of the VAB, he said this Clause refers to the creation of an entirely new entity called the Village Development Council (VDC).
“Though Section (I) says that the VDC will be under the supervision of the Dorbar Shnong and will be accountable to it, Section (IV) of the clause however envisages the election of a chairman for the VDC. This serves to set up a new authority in the village which so far recognizes only the customary Dorbar Shnong and the Rangbah Shnong,” Syiem observed.
FKS also observed that the new power centre would usurp all powers and responsibilities of the traditional Dorbar Shnong.
Referring to Clause 15 of the VAB, he said this particular clause gives the VDC functions and responsibilities that has always been under the purview of the Dorbar Shnong.
“These two clauses in the VAB have ended up uprooting the Khasi customary offices by taking away its functions in the modern democratic set-up while attempting to replace them with a clone which has no roots in our history or our traditions and one which will be competing with the customary offices for people’s loyalty. This legislation sought to be an instrument to help these customary offices evolve into modernity,” he said.
According to him, the Khasi traditional governance is based on the three-tier system of Dorbar Shnong, Raid and Hima.
“Governance in these hills has been maintained democratically since time immemorial and this system was found functioning by the British who arrived on these shores and eventually brought us forcibly under their colonial rule,” he said, adding that the Khasi customary governance system was imported into the British India’s legal framework of governance by a series of Treaties and Laws over time leaving intact the customary institutions which remain the foundation of Khasi society.
“With Independence in 1947, these Treaties and Laws were incorporated into our country’s Constitutional framework by default, but leaving unheeded over the decades, a felt need for firm bonding of the Khasi Grassroots governance bodies with the mainframe of the country through targeted legislations for better service to the people,” Syiem said."

752,Border fencing: Land hurdles delay project,"Monday, July 13, 2015","SHILLONG: Though Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh has urged the chief ministers of the Northeastern states to ensure proper strengthening of international borders and launch sustained drives against illegal weapons and make the region free from such illegal arms, the cause of worry for Meghalaya is that more than 100 kilometers of international border with Bangladesh in Meghalaya Frontier remains unfenced and easily penetrable.
BSF sources informed on Sunday that fencing work was going in certain area and the respective deputy commissioners of East Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills were involved in the process of convincing the land owners to part away with their land for the fencing work.
BSF officials have pointed out that negotiations were going on with the land owners to acquire the land for border fencing considering that the Union Government has asked the State Government to expedite the land acquisition process.
Singh had asked the chief ministers concerned to provide land for border fencing and expedite land acquisition on urgent basis wherever pending.
Meanwhile, BSF officials have also attributed the slow progress of fencing work to the ongoing Monsoon season.
Reacting to a query, BSF officials said there was always a demand for more troops in bordering areas since BSF has to conduct additional duties during elections, counter insurgency operations and others.
The BSF has already made a demand to the Central Government for sanction of additional battalions in Meghalaya since the 443-km long international border in the Meghalaya Frontier is currently manned by nine battalions of the border force."
753,Cong expels GHADC sitting MDC,"Monday, July 13, 2015","SHILLONG: Ahead of the GHADC polls, the Congress has expelled Ditarson D. Shira, the sitting MDC from Damas.
The District Congress Committee North Garo Hills in a statement issued here on Sunday said the Committee in its emergency meeting held recently took disciplinary action and expelled Ditarson D. Shira from the Congress for his anti-party activities.
Though the reason the Congress in North Garo Hills cites is that Shira had indulged in anti-party activities by working against the official candidates of the party both in the Assembly elections in 2013 and the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, the immediate cause appears to be the plan of the Congress to give    the party ticket to some other candidate for the GHADC polls.
When contacted to know why the Congress had acted late in taking action, the North Garo Hills Congress functionary Chisal R. Sangma said that since the complaint came in June from the Mendipathar Block Congress, action was taken accordingly.
Shira was not available for comments on what led to his expulsion from the party.
The North Garo Hills District Congress Committee said that his non-cooperation with the party has led to the defeat of Congress candidate F.W. Momin by a negligible margin of 11 votes in the Assembly elections in 2013.
“Shira also failed to enroll himself as the member of INC in the North Garo Hills District Congress Committee and willfully ignored party activities and failed  to attend even a single party meeting ever since his induction,” the North Garo Hills Congress alleged."
754,Slain GNLA militant’s mother questions police ‘brutality’,"Monday, July 13, 2015","Tura: The mother of Savio Ch Marak, GNLA’s joint publicity secretary who was shot dead by police at Rengregre village near Williamnagar on Thursday morning, has accused the police of violating the body of her son by taking inappropriate pictures to humiliate their victim.
“Is it justified to open the pants of a militant shot dead and take photos of the naked portion and upload it on social networks for others to share?” questioned the mother in a statement to the media.
“My son is already dead and will not feel the pain. It is our family who has to live with the humiliation of witnessing the pictures being uploaded and shared by the public. What was the need to open the pants and take the pictures?” asked Savio’s mother.
Pictures of the militant shot dead with some showing gory details went viral on social network sites within hours of the encounter with criticism flying thick and fast as photos revealed a rope tied to one of the hands of the victim.
The Meghalaya Police had to issue a quick clarification to stem the rumour mongering of alleged torture by stating that the rope was used only to turn the body and check for booby traps.
The mother of the deceased militant has said that militancy needs to end in Garo Hills but accused police of orchestrating a fake encounter.
“I do not support killing someone caught alive. They could have taken him in for questioning,” said the mother while leveling accusations against the police.
She claimed that her son’s fate had been sealed months earlier when Meghalaya Police announced a reward of five lakh rupees for the capture of Savio ‘dead or alive’.
“I knew then that he would not be brought back alive,” she mentioned.
Contradicting Meghalaya Police claims that Savio    had intended to surrender in 2013 but was persuaded by his family not to do so for fear of reprisal by Sohan Shira, the mother has given a different version.
“Ever since he ran away from police to join GNLA in January, 2011 while on duty during the Garo-Rabha clashes I reached out time and again to him to give up arms. I told him that he would gain nothing by going against the government. But he refused to listen to the appeals of his mother, his younger sister and his wife resulting in this tragedy,” said the heartbroken mother."

Urban Affairs Minister Ampareen Lyngdoh asserted that 140 units of the project was being implemented by the Urban Affairs department itself and the units would be ready by January next and operational by February.
According to Lyngdoh, a proposal for sanction of more units has been sent to the Central Government and is currently at the advance stage of approval.
HPL was tasked with constructing 600 dwelling units for the urban poor at Nongmynsong area in the city in 2007 and another 240 dwelling units at Nongpoh in 2009 at a total cost of Rs.3962.25 lakh under the Centrally-sponsored JNNURM.
The company recently backed out of the project ostensibly after facing labour problems. The State Government terminated the contract with HPL after the latter backed out from the project.
Reacting to a query about the beneficiaries of the project, Lyngdoh pointed out   that the list of beneficiaries was generated in 2004-2005.
However, she added that the list will be updated and the families who have ‘up scaled’ their economic growth over this period will be deleted from the list.
Out of the 600 housing units, which are to be constructed under the Centrally-sponsored JNNURM Basic Service of Urban Poor (BSUP) Scheme initiated in 2007, only 96 have been completed so far."

The State-owned Baljek airport was handed over to the State Transport Department by the West Garo Hills District Administration last year.
The airport, however, has remained non-functional since its inauguration despite proposals from private airlines to operate smaller flights from it.
According to sources, land has already been acquired for the expansion of the Baljek airport and even the compensation has been paid to the land owners. However, one stretch of the airport is caught in a legal tangle with two nokmas claiming ownership to the same piece of land.
The matter is pending in court and the district administration will pay the compensation to whoever wins the case.
It may be mentioned that the district administration has acquired 58 acres of land for the expansion of the airport at a budget of over Rs 2.58 cr.
The expansion would pave way for landing of at least 30-seater aircrafts in the airport which has remained non functional since the time it was inaugurated by the then president of India, Pratibha Patil.
The airport set up at Jengjal, around 33 kms from Tura, was built at a cost of Rs 12.52 crore.
It was inaugurated on October 23, 2008 by Patil when the UDP-NCP led government was in power in the state.
The airport also has other requirements such as presence of armed personnel for security purposes.
Since its inception, the project was marred in controversy as the proposal was sent to the Centre in 1983, but was sanctioned only in 1995.
On more than one occasion in the past there were indications that the Baljek airport may soon become functional but to no avail."

774,State Cabinet wants citizens to vote in their places of origin,"Saturday, July 11, 2015","SHILLONG: In a decision which would be in violation to the Election Commission of India guidelines, the State Cabinet on Friday urged the Centre to allow citizens to have the right to vote in their places of origin and not where they reside temporarily.
The Cabinet made a decision in this regard by stating that in the context of rise in migrant labourers in the State coupled with constant mistrust affecting the overall growth of society, the suggestion to give rights to people to vote in their places of origin and not where they reside temporarily or migrate for their professional activities was approved.
The Government said that the decision was made after going through the agenda on Centre-State Relations in the Cabinet.
The Cabinet has decided to send this decision to the Centre.
However, the urgency of the Cabinet to make a decision on unexpected line was not explained as the Government had not taken any such decision during the agitation called by the pressure groups demanding implementation of ILP.
If the Cabinet decision is accepted even the IAS officers from outside the State posted in Meghalaya would not be able to vote in the State they will have to go back to their places of origin.
Sources said that the Government made this ‘frank and blunt suggestion’ apparently in the wake of unrest in Manipur due to the death of a student who, among others, was protesting against the apathy of the Government to implement ILP in that State.
Moreover, another possibility is the upcoming elections in Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC), where the Congress-led MUA-II wants to project itself as the protector of    the indigenous people, sources added.
The Cabinet during its meeting referred to the notification of the Election Commission of India which said, “whoever is a temporary resident should be enumerated as voter”, which, according to the Government will bring mistrust in the State.
Elaborating on this, the Cabinet felt that this issue is one of the reasons which results in the kind of ‘mistrust’ between the local population and migrants.
According to the Cabinet,” from the perspective of true democracy, the people should analyze   “whether they are considered as true stakeholders in the electoral process since their votes will also determine the outcome of any election and outcome of an election can be determined by a single vote.”
The Cabinet is of the view that those who vote should be stakeholders in the democracy and they are equally responsible for the outcome of electoral process which is either good governance or bad governance.
According to the Government, a true voter in his place of origin will also be associated with the risk of mis-governance if his vote has actually resulted in formation of government which could neither deliver nor live up to the expectation of the people."

778,SWGH headman certifies villager as ‘ganja smuggler’,"Saturday, July 11, 2015","TURA: In a shocking display of malevolence and misuse of power, a village Gaonbura (headman) in South West Garo Hills has issued a character certificate to an illiterate person describing his profession as a ‘ganja smuggler’.
Md. Abdus Sattar, headman of Ghugrakandi, Kulupara and Barmanpara villages under Mahendraganj issued the questionable character certificate to one Billal Sk, a resident of Village Majherchar-II on June 25 this year.
The irresponsible act from a man of his position has earned him the wrath of resident of the three villages who are rallying for his removal as they are not satisfied with his way of functioning in other areas as well.
In their official complaint to the GHADC, the villagers alleged that the headman was selfish, arbitrary and dictatorial towards the people.
They claimed that relief materials meant for last year’s flood victims was misused and distributed to the affected in lesser quantities than what the district administration had prescribed.
The leftover rice, pulses and cooking oil was then distributed among his committee members, the villagers claimed.
According to the villagers there arose a discrepancy due to a spelling error in the name of one of the beneficiaries during the distribution of relief materials who was asked by the district administration to produce a certificate issued by the headman.
However, when the aggrieved person, Billal Sk approached the headman for the same, he issued the certificate describing the applicant’s profession as a ‘ganja smuggler’ merely out of spite.
“The very act of issuing such certificate to an innocent and illiterate villager clearly shows that he is unreliable and unfit for the position. We want him removed as he does not care for the welfare of the villagers,” they demanded.
The villagers further alleged that many deserving candidates had been deprived of their appointment as teachers in Primary, Upper Primary and the Majherchar Secondary School as the headman had allegedly used his clout to get his relatives and well wishers appointed instead.
According to them, the headman was also demanding commission for each and every withdrawal made by various VEC Secretaries for any work or scheme under MGNREGS."
779,M’laya to approach Centre,"Saturday, July 11, 2015","Call for allowing State to form its  own guidelines in implementing Central schemes
SHILLONG: The State Government has decided to approach the Centre to allow it to structure its own guidelines for implementing the centrally sponsored schemes. The decision was taken after a proposal in this regard was made in the Cabinet meeting held here on Friday.
The Government said that considering the kind of diversity that comes into play with the involvement of different local systems of governance, the Cabinet felt that it is imperative that a mechanism should be adopted by the Union Government to allow states to structure their own guidelines while implementing centrally sponsored schemes.
According to the Cabinet, at present, most of the centrally sponsored schemes are implemented based on the various guidelines adopted by the Union Government which are more or less uniform across the country.
The Cabinet felt that owing to the present uniform guidelines, most of the North Eastern states have not been able to implement the centrally sponsored schemes.
Citing an example, the Cabinet pointed out that the guidelines of the JNNURM required the states to fulfill a number of reforms which included the need to have an elected body in the local urban bodies which the government tried to implement but could not since it is linked with the sentiments of the people.
The Cabinet said that in order to ensure that states are capable of fully absorbing the schemes, there is a need to enable them to structure the guidelines in a manner that makes the schemes implementable.
The dispensation of resource transfer to the state government as a special grant must continue in respect to the NE states, the Cabinet felt."
780,When poetry weds music to convey human alienation,"Saturday, July 11, 2015","Shillong: Grit and determination define septuagenarian Cassandra Syiemlieh who has compiled her dissertation submitted 30 years ago to the North Eastern Hill University (NEHU) into a book titled The West Wind of All Time Popular Music: The Poetic Voice of Mankind.
The book released by R.G. Lyngdoh, Vice Chancellor, Martin Luther Christian University (MLCU), on Friday, is a body of work that explores the meanings behind the lyrics of western music of the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s from singers like Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, John Denver, Joan Baez amongst others.
Addressing a cross section of audience at the book launch, Cassandra Syiemlieh said English literature is replete with singing tones.
“Singers like Dylan and Joan Baez carry on their traditional roles as bards and imbue their generation with the tenacity to deal with problems facing their societies such as racial prejudices, denial of human rights, the nuclear arms race, environmental degradation etc., and   enable their generation to tell stories of hardships and struggles using the medium of music.
“Song writers are not unaware of current events – political, economic and social. They do not hesitate to express in songs the evil elements running in such events.” Syiemlieh says in her book.
Lyngdoh lauded Syiemlieh for pursuing her passion and making it a reality.
“The 70s and 80’s were a turning point in history where people reacted through songs. In fact the best window for looking into the history of a particular era is to look thru the songs of those days,” Lyngdoh said adding that it must have been very tough for the author to have to listen to the lyrics of the songs using a tape recorder and to have to pause, rewind and restart again and again. Also to have to type out the manuscript because there were no computers then is quite an effort which only the very dedicated can achieve.
Dr. Sylvanus Lamare, Principal, St. Edmund’s College, who was the guest of honour at the function, said he admired Syiemlieh for her tenacity of purpose.
“She would sit at the NEHU Library at Mayurbhanj (where NEHU was then located) poring over books and literature to cull out what she needed. She was fortunate to have a guide in Prof. E.N. Lall who understood the impact of literature on music. I read her manuscript ten years ago but could not find a publisher because there were no takers for such totally new venture,” Dr. Lamare observed.
Dr. Lamare also paid rich tributes to Syiemlieh’s late mother, Listrimai Syiemlieh, who was a radio artiste and whose work is recorded in the annals of Sacred Heart College, Mawlai.
It may be reminded that Cassandra Syiemlieh was a teacher of English Literature at St. Edmund’s College until she retired some 15 years ago."

808,5-yr in jail proposed for ‘racial profiling’ of North East people,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","New Delhi: Calling people of the Northeastern region by ‘derogatory’ names will soon become a non-bailable offence and land you in jail for up to five years.
The Ministry of Home Affairs told the Delhi High Court on Wednesday that it has decided to amend the IPC to strengthen the legal framework against racial discrimination.
“The Ministry of Home Affairs is in process of finalising a comprehensive bill for insertion of new sections of 153c and 509A in Indian Penal Code (IPC) which will be introduced in Parliament after inter-ministerial consultation,” a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Jayant Nath was told.
Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain handed over the copy of the action taken report on behalf of MHA and other Ministries, saying the Home Ministry accepted a recommendation of the M.K. Bezbaruah committee constituted in February 2014, following a spate of attacks against people from the region living in Delhi.
Besides insertion of new sections in the IPC, facilities for legal assistance, special police initiatives, bonding power of sports and educating the people about the North East have been also taken care of, ASG Jain said.
The proposed Section 153C makes imputations and assertions prejudicial to human dignity and makes words, both spoken and written, or signs attempting to discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, or indulging in activity intended to use criminal force or violence against a particular race, a non-bailable offence punishable with imprisonment up to five years with fine.
The proposed Section 509A seeks to make any word, gesture or act intended to insult a member of a particular race with imprisonment that may extend to three years with fine.
The Centre had set up the committee after a 19-year-old Arunachal Pradesh student Nido Tania was killed in an alleged racial attack in Lajpat Nagar locality in South Delhi in January 2014.
The ASG, who was assisted by Central government standing counsel Sanjeev Narula, submitted before the court that Delhi State Legal Service Authority has constituted a panel of seven lawyers including five women for assisting people from the North East.
“Revised Delhi Victim Compensation Scheme 2015 will be made which will be operated by Delhi State Legal Service Authority. The investigation would be completed in such matters within 30 days and the compensation would be made within 24 hours of passing order. The compensation amount may be raised to Rs 25,000 per person,” the report said.
The Centre’s response came in the backdrop of the court’s earlier order expressing anguish over continuing incidents of violence against people from the North East and seeking a report from the government on the steps taken to curb ‘the menace plaguing the society’.
The Union Home Ministry also proposed that “in our education system, North East culture may be highlighted, and the contribution made by the people from North East in the national Movement may also be highlighted.
“The topics on historical movements of North East, writers and poets of the North East etc. should be included in the curriculum.
“A booklet, indicating attractive tourist destination in North East may be printed and circulated in the metro cities colleges/universities etc. The tourist destinations may also be advertised in the leading news papers. Feedback may also be obtained from the people who make trips to the tourist places in North East,” MHA said, adding that this would help in understanding North East India better.
The report said the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has taken initiative to focus on North East and constituted inter-media publicity co-ordination committee on the issue.
In order to address the grievances of North East people of higher rent being charged and their eviction without any prior notice, it was suggested that the rent law should be reviewed and amendments need to be made, it said.
“To resolve the wages problem, Labour Department of Delhi has issued circular wherein directions for making payment to the employees through cheques has been made mandatory in order to check the non-payment of wages.
“Moreover, the working people are encouraged to register themselves as a union for better redressal of their grievances including low wages and job security,” ASG told the court.
Ministry of Culture has also chalked out a series of activities to be conducted in Delhi and other metropolitan cities in the 2015-16, it added. (PTI)"
809,NGT ban: Hearing deferred till July 23,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal court on Wednesday deferred till July 23 the hearing on the ban on coal mining in Meghalaya since the State Government counsel had sought more time for submission of certain facts.
Wednesday’s hearing was on further extension of time for transportation of extracted coal and payment of royalty to the government.
The coal miners and owners were to make a similar appeal before the NGT as the extracted coal is yet to be fully transported. June 30 was the deadline for transportation of extracted coal.
A status report on the present situation following the ban on coal mining was to be presented before NGT during the hearing on Wednesday which will now be done on July 23.
Besides, the report of action taken against violations of NGT ban on coal mining prepared by the respective deputy commissioners will be submitted before the Tribunal on that day.
The NGT will also be informed about the measures being initiated by the Meghalaya Government for the mining plan as the officials of Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, Coal India Limited and Director General of Mine Safety based in Guwahati had already visited the State on June 17 and 18.
The team, besides meeting State Government officials, had also visited several coal mines in Jaintia Hills to prepare guidelines for coal mining in the State.
The assistance of the Central establishment was sought since the State Government did not have expertise for carrying out coal mining in a scientific way.
Pending mining plan and adoption of proper scientific mining methods, the NGT is unlikely to review the ban on coal mining in the State during the July 23 hearing.
It was on April 17 last year that the NGT in an interim order had banned rat hole mining of coal in Meghalaya.
Fourteen months after the ban, the Tribunal is insisting only on transportation of the already extracted coal after payment of requisite royalty."
810,N-E CEMs to demand Ministry for ADCs,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","SHILLONG: Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in the Northeastern region have unanimously resolved to demand a separate Ministry that will exclusively deal with development of the areas falling under the district councils.
“We will move the Centre for constitution of a Ministry for Development of Autonomous District Councils under the Sixth Schedule,” KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem told newsmen after a one-of-its kind meeting of the Chief Executive Members (CEMs) of the ADCs in the Northeastern region here on Wednesday.
Claiming that the allocation of funds to the various ADCs of the region for development of the areas under the Councils was grossly inadequate, Syiem said, “We have decided to suggest to the Centre to announce an annual special package for the Sixth Schedule areas.”
“We feel that we need to have a separate Ministry which will focus on the development of the Sixth Schedule areas,” the KHADC CEM added.
The meeting constituted a Forum of Councils under the Sixth Schedule (FOCUSS) to pursue the issue of the final draft of the proposed amendment of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution.
The Forum will be headed by the KHADC CEM as chairman and North Cachar Hills CEM Debojeet Thaosen as member secretary and will have one representative from each of the ADCs in the region.
“We are unhappy with certain proposals in the final draft of the amendment. Therefore, we have decided to constitute the forum which will earnestly follow up the issue with the Ministry of Home Affairs,” the KHADC CEM said.
He also said that they will submit a formal memorandum to the Ministry after collecting views and suggestion of all the ADCs on the proposed amendment.
It was informed that the Forum would seek appointment with Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Minister of State Kiren Rijiju during their scheduled visit to Guwahati    next week.
“We have also decided to demand deletion of Paragraph 12A of the Sixth Schedule,” Syiem said, while adding that they have unanimously decided to accept the provision that the ADCs would enjoy central funding under Article 280.
Syiem also informed that the ADCs were concerned over the zero allocation of funds by the 14th Finance Commission.
Meanwhile, Debojeet Thaosen, CEM of North Cachar Hills ADC, expressed concern over the proposal to include Article 14A in the final draft of the Sixth Schedule.
Quoting Article 14A, he said, “The Article states that the Governor shall make, quarterly or whenever so required by the President, a report to the President regarding the administration of the Tribal areas by the District Councils in the State and Executive Power of the Union shall extend to the giving of direction to the State as to the administration of such areas.”
According to him, this section can be used against the Council since the Article can be misused to dissolve the Council on the recommendation of the State or the Centre.
It was also resolved that the Governor should not reject any bill passed by the ADCs on two occasions.
The meeting also resolved to push the Centre for inclusion of a new Paragraph 9 A in the Sixth Schedule whereby any power companies including Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) should provide free power and revenue to the respective ADC.
The KHADC CEM further informed that the meeting decided to propose to change the three Autonomous District Councils in Mizoram (Lei, Chakma and Mar) into Autonomous Territorial Councils (ATC).
While informing that the CEM of Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council and Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council could not make it to the meeting, the KHADC chief said that the two Councils have assured to endorse all the decisions taken during Wednesday’s meeting."
811,First-ever PG course in N-E studies announced,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","New Delhi: Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jitendra Singh, on Wednesday announced the introduction of the country’s first-ever recognized Post Graduation Masters degree course in ‘Northeast studies’.
Singh made the announcement following a visit to the Centre for Northeast Studies in Jamia Millia Islamia University where he convened a meeting with Vice Chancellor, Prof. Talat Ahmed, Head of Northeast Studies, Prof. Sanjoy Hazarika and other faculty members to give a final shape to the decision.
“For India this is a totally new and unique initiative of its kind because this will be for   the first time that any Indian University will introduce a formal recognized Post Graduation Degree Course in region based studies.
“The concept of region based research and study within a university was, by and large, hitherto unknown in the Indian academia and mostly existed in some European universities and therefore, with the introduction of this course, not only the Jamia Millia Islamia University will acquire a distinct identity of its own but the Northeastern part of India will also earn a unique academic distinction,” he said.
Singh said there is often talk of bringing North East closer to mainstream India but he has personally always subscribed to the idea of simultaneously bringing mainstream India closer to Northeast. The new initiative, therefore, would be a promising step in that direction, he added.
“It is a little known fact that North East has a very high literacy rate with a small state like Mizoram recording a literacy rate of 92% to 93%, second only to Kerala,” he said.
In addition, he said, students and faculty of Northeast origin are making a very valuable contribution in the leading colleges and universities of union capital and other Indian metros.
“DoNER plans to promote Centres for Northeast Studies as resource banks for people from outside Northeast to understand and study the exclusive culture and richness of that region. He assured the Vice Chancellor that the DoNER Ministry will offer all its cooperation in making the initiative successful,” Singh said.
It was informed that a formal PG Master’s course in Northeast studies will begin from next academic session one optional paper on Northeast has already been introduced in post graduation exam from the current academic year."

After he was brought before the Court on Wednesday, he was soon taken into judicial custody.
The matter is likely to come up on Thursday.

813,Call for CBI inquiry into Victoria’s death,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","SHILLONG: Slamming the Assam Police over the death of a woman from Meghalaya at Dispur Police station in Guwahati, the CSWO and the KSU on Wednesday called for a CBI inquiry into the matter.
The CSWO termed the arrest of the victim, Victoria D Kharkongor, as a violation of Supreme Court guidelines which state that no woman shall be arrested after sunset or before sunrise, except in exceptional cases and that too after obtaining permission from a magistrate.
The CSWO further pointed out that no relative of the woman was informed about her arrest soon after leading to another violation of the rules laid down by the Court.
“The person arrested must be made aware of his/her right to have someone informed of his/her arrest as soon as he/she is detained,” the CSWO said.
“Further, if as reported, the police say that she was mentally unstable then they should have referred her to a psychiatrist instead of arresting her. These procedures were not followed by the Dispur Police,” the CSWO said.
Demanding a CBI inquiry into the death of the woman, the CSWO also said that the Assam Government should compensate the family of the victim for failing to protect her.
The KSU, similarly, questioned the credibility of the Dispur Police in the matter.
“We are unable to digest the version of the police in this case,” KSU president Daniel Khyriem said in a statement issued here on Wednesday.
He added that the union will take up the matter with the All Assam Students’ Union to ensure speedy justice for the unfortunate family of the victim.

814,3 GNLA militants nabbed in WGH,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","TURA: West Garo Hills Police on Tuesday afternoon arrested three suspected GNLA militants from Gambegre village in connection with last week’s abduction of a trader from Purakhasia.
The arrest has also thrown light on a recent IED explosion outside a hardware store in the heart of Tura town which left nine persons injured.
Police picked up the three GNLA suspects identified as Junepaul D Sangma (22) of Rakuapara, Kamet S Sangma (24) of Chengapara village and Bikgrak S Sangma (23) of Gambegre, a day after Purakhasia cloth merchant Mundi Prasad was released by militants following the alleged payment of ransom.

815,Absentee doctors in Jaintia Hills health centres irk HNYF,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","SHILLONG: With 90 per cent of the health centres in Jaintia Hills functioning for only two or three days in a week, the HNYF East Jaintia Hills region has urged the State Government to ensure that the doctors attend to their duties regularly in the best interest of the people of the region.
Talking to newsmen here on Wednesday, HNYF East Jaintia Hills region leader, Lamsuk Langstang alleged that majority of the doctors who are attached with the various PHCs and CHCs remain absent from work.
“Many of the doctors would be there only for two to three days in a week thus creating a lot of inconvenience to the people,” Langstang said.
He said that unavailability of common medicines for illnesses like diarrhoea, fever and other common diseases has brought further misery to the people who are totally dependent on a few health centers for their health care.
According to him, most of the health sub centres are running without electricity, water supply and other amenities like toilets. The HNYF also mentioned that during their meeting with State Health Minister AL Hek, it was informed that the main problem in every health care centre is the shortage of man power.
“The minister himself has revealed that there is a shortage of man power which makes it difficult for the government to post three to four doctors in every CHC,” Langstang said.
In this connection, the HNYF demanded that at least one doctor should be posted in every PHC and two in every CHC besides ensuring proper functioning of these health centres 24X7.
The organisation also met PWD minister Sniawbhalang Dhar on Wednesday to apprise him of the pathetic condition of roads in the area.
“We have apprised the minister of the present condition of the roads in Jaintia Hills region especially Saipung block where there is no proper road,” Langstang said.
He also said that there is only one road leading to Saipung block and the same caused inconvenience to people of many villages as they have to travel 55 kms through Sutnga-Nongkhlieh-Saipung instead of 15-20 kms. “Sumer Patorship with 22 villages under its jurisdiction and located close to Saipung should be connected with a road leading straight to Saipung as this will reduce the distance to  15-20 kms from Pala directly to Saipung  compared to the present road,” he said.
In response, the PWD minister informed the group that the government is proposing to sanction Rs 600 crore for development of roads and other infrastructures in the border areas.
The HNYF delegation also met Home Minister Roshan Warjri to discuss the setting up of Police Outposts in five areas under East Jaintia Hills-Umkyrpong, Umkhru, Kharduli, Saba and Ksiar."

The denial came after a receipt given under hand and seal of the union’s general secretary, Salman D Sangma for an amount of Rs 300 supposedly for a Shillong trip was obtained from one of the teer counters and published in The Shillong Times (Garo Hills Edition) on Wednesday.
The leaders claimed that they were completely in the dark about the illegal collection and the supposed Shillong trip by their general secretary and claimed that the collection was being done for his own self interest.
“None of the other leaders have any knowledge about the illegal collection from teer counters or the supposed Shillong trip. The general secretary is collecting the money for his own interests and we strongly condemn it,” they jointly said in a statement.

819,Umroi Airport stalemate continues,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","SHILLONG: A stalemate of sorts continues to plague the proposed expansion of the Shillong airport located at Umroi.
Speaking to The Shillong Times on Tuesday, General Manager (Engineering), Airport Authority of India (AAI) Regional office, Sreekumar said that a village road that passes right through the heart of the airport is proving to be the biggest hurdle as far as the expansion work is concerned.
He pointed out that the AAI needs to construct the boundary wall in order to undertake the expansion work of the project. “Before that is done, the road has to be diverted,” he said adding that the villagers and the authorities are trying to arrive at a solution.
He also said that there are some villagers who have reportedly not been given the compensation and the State Government  needs to sort out such issues before the AAI can undertake the expansion work.
Last year, the State government had said that Rs. 44,89,00,000 has been disbursed to landowners.
The Government also clarified that a supplementary proposal for land acquisition around Umroi airport amounting to Rs. 11,44,03,177 was submitted by the Ri Bhoi Deputy Commissioner which after examination was referred back by the Government to the district administration to submit the land acquisition proposal according to the provision of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and to re-submit fresh supplementary award for inclusion of the amount payable on account of re-classification of land.
Reacting to a query about financial allocations, the AAI official said that there is no point in making necessary sanctions until and unless all hurdles are cleared.
It may be mentioned that the runway of the airport needs to be expanded from the present 6000 feet to 7500 feet to facilitate the landing of bigger aircrafts.
The airport also lacks basic facilities such as  refueling station, hanger and Advance Landing System.
At the moment, only one ATR aircraft lands at the Shillong airport from Kolkata and the services are not at all reliable as the flight is often cancelled.
It was in the 1960s that Umroi airport was constructed and subsequently Shillong was placed in the civil aviation map on September 6, 1974. A Dakota aircraft landed in Umroi only to be discontinued in August 1976.  In 1981, A Vayudoot air service started operational from Umroi directly to Kolkata, but the service lasted only for a short duration. Later in January 1984 it was re-introduced with F-27 type aircraft which also came to a close in 1991.
From the year 2000, there were talks about expansion of Umroi airport, but in vain as land acquisition process took several years.  Though the 50-seater aircraft was made operational more than 10 years ago, the flights were irregular thanks to the absence of advanced technologies coupled with the undue delay in expansion of the airport."
820,‘Meghalaya a national habitat of aromatic and medicinal plants’,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","SHILLONG: In an effort to connect Meghalaya’s farmers to the herbal industry, the Meghalaya Basin Development Authority has inked an MOU with the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP).  This is a 56-year-old plant research laboratory formerly known as Central Indian Medicinal Plants Organisation (CIMPO).
Dr Anil Kumar Tripathi, Director, CIMAP who is on a visit to Shillong, addressed an audience comprising students, teachers and others at the Asian Confluence on Wednesday. He said Meghalaya is the natural habitat of aromatic and medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua from which the most effective anti-malarial drug artemisinin is extracted from the leaves of the plant.
“Currently only one-fourth of the country’s requirement of Artemisia is produced in India. The rest is imported,” Dr Tripathi informed.
“Artemisia grows in the wilds and can be cultivated in degraded lands where it can be harvested 2-3 times a year. The important point is that the farmer must have a buy-back arrangement with the companies and the MBDA can help create that bridge,” Dr Tripathi said.
Speaking of CIMAP Dr Tripathi informed that the Institute is engaged in ground-breaking research in biotechnology and molecular biology with the purpose of taking science to the field and to the farmers and also to connect farmers to the herbal industry which requires a sustained supply of raw materials.
One of the rare achievements of CIMAP is to turn India into the largest producer and exporter of menthol a derivative of the Menthe arvensis or wild pudina (Japanese mint). Under the former director of CIMAP, Dr Akhtar Hussain a high yielding variety of Menthe arvensis with higher content of essential oils was developed. Later the farmers were provided distillation units to extract the essential oil (menthol) which is in great demand. Today this industry has a 4000 crore turnover.
“Since farmers don’t want to let out their fields during the Kharif and Rabi season we have now developed a strain of Menthe arvensis which grows within 60-70 days at the time when the land is fallow”, Dr Tripathi informed.
Pointing to the urgent need to cultivate and not just collect these medicinal and aromatic plants, Dr Tripathi said the habit of collecting these plants has resulted in their over-exploitation to the point that most of them are now extinct. “We need to cultivate these plants so that we have a sustainable supply for the pharmaceutical industry,” Dr Tripathi explained.
Stating that CIMAP has developed completely biodegradable sanitary pads using essential oils, Dr Tripathi said nowhere in the world is this technology available.
“Johnsons and Johnson want to buy exclusive rights from CIMAP but we do not want to sell an idea to a company because we want to make this sanitary pad available for women in our country,” Tripathi informed.
Urging the students to become entrepreneurs in the business of aromatic and medicinal herbs, Dr Tripathi said this is a huge industry and requires young people to start growing these medicinal herbs which grow so well in the North Eastern states.
Established originally as Central Indian Medicinal Plants Organisation (CIMPO) in 1959, CIMAP is steering multidisciplinary high quality research in biological and chemical sciences and extending technologies and services to the farmers and entrepreneurs of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) through its research headquarters at Lucknow.

Addressing the gathering during the half-day workshop with traditional healers of Meghalaya on Tuesday, Tsering asserted that there are many people who had strong faith in the traditional medicine system.
“Lack of degree or certification is not an indication of their (traditional healers’) lack of knowledge but rather goes on to show that documentation of this medicine system is lacking,” Tsering pointed out."

SHILLONG: Home Minister Roshan Warjri has directed the State chief secretary and the director general of police to get a detailed report from their Assam counterparts on the mysterious death of Victoria Kharkongor at Dispur police station on Sunday night.

828,Family demands independent probe,"Wednesday, July 8, 2015","SHILLONG: Alleging foul play, the family of late Victoria Kharkongor has demanded an independent inquiry to probe into her death under mysterious circumstances inside a toilet at Dispur police station on Sunday night.
“We demand an independent inquiry since we are not convinced with the suicide theory of Dispur police,” Belin Kharkongor, mother of the deceased, told newsmen at her residence at Nongthymmai Lawjynriew on Tuesday.
She urged the State Government to closely follow the matter to ensure that the truth comes out and also to ensure that no girl from the State faces a similar consequence.
Claiming that she had no idea on why her daughter landed at the International Hospital in Guwahati, the mother said that if her daughter was mentally unstable then Dispur police should have shifted her to a health centre as they are not professionally trained to attend to people who are mentally unstable.
The mother also questioned why Dispur police had not informed the relatives about her after taking her into custody.
“I am also surprised why the hospital authorities handed her over to the police. The hospital would have had psychiatrist who could have provided counseling to find out her actual state of mind. The hospital has failed to perform its duties,” Kharkongor alleged.
Kharkongor vehemently rebutted the mentally unstable theory propounded by Dispur police, saying,
“If she was mentally unstable then she would have never been able to teach.”
Maintaining that there was foul play in the death of her daughter, Kharkongor said, “I have seen the toilet at Dispur police station. It is impossible for any person to commit suicide inside the toilet. There is also no sign on the body that could prove that she had committed suicide. I could see only a slight cut near the neck.”
The mother of the deceased even claimed that Dispur police had asked her to sign on a blank sheet of paper.
“When I questioned them they claimed that they  wanted the signed paper in order to note down a list of belongings of the deceased which had to be surrendered to the family,” she informed, while adding that Dispur police has not returned Victoria’s travel bag containing her clothes and documents.
She further claimed that she had received only one out of the two mobile phones, pan card, identity card and a railway ticket from the hand bag which was handed over by Dispur police.
Meanwhile, Kharkongor revealed that the last time she had heard from her daughter was on July 3 at around 4.20 pm when Victoria’s sister called her up and she informed that she had reached Howrah railway station and was on her way to Guwahati.
“After this, she switched off both her mobile phones,” the mother said.
The mother went on to say that Victoria was quite happy with her profession and showed no signs of depression when they had last met in June.
Death condemned: Nongthymmai legislator Jemino Mawthoh has strongly condemned Kharkongor’s death.
“Going by the narration of the relatives, I strongly suspect there is a foul play,” Mawthoh said, while adding that he has taken up the matter with Home Minister Roshan Warjri to closely follow the case.
Nongthymmai MDC Latiplang Kharkongor, while condemning the death, urged the State Government to take up the issue with the Assam Government in the right earnest.
“We would want the truth to come out,” the MDC said.

850,90:10 funding pattern to stay,"Tuesday, July 7, 2015","Finance Minister Arun Jaitley’s assurance to Meghalaya Govt
NEWDELHI: In a major breakthrough, the Centre seems to be veering round to restore the 90:10 formula for the Northeastern states instead of 50:50 proposal and also to re-examine the continuation of the special Central assistance programmes for the remote and backward region.
This was indicated during a meeting between Union Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley and a state government representative at the former’s North Block office here. The Finance Minister is leaving for the BRICS summit on Tuesday.
So far, the North East states used to get 90 percent grant and 10 percent loan, but  50 percent grant and 50 percent loan was suggested  with the BJP-led NDA Government coming to power and accepting the report of the 14thFinance Commission. Such a blow will heavily hit the microscopic ethnic minority of the North Eastern states, the Chief Ministers of the region had cautioned earlier.
Jaitley was told that the 14th Finance Commission has recommended 42 per cent out of the divisible pool as the share of the North East states in the form of tax devolution. In case of Meghalaya its share out of the 42 per cent will come to just 0.642 per cent depending on the population, forest cover and other factors.
It was also pointed out to Jaitley that if the North East states including Meghalaya were treated at par with the rest of India in terms of devolution of tax, there would not be any difference between the ‘special category states’ and ‘ordinary states’ as far as share of tax from the centre was concerned. Big and advanced states like Maharashtra and Gujarat will   take the lion’s share leaving peanuts for the small hill states.
The Union Finance Minister is also taking up with the Prime Minister about continuance of the special central assistance schemes for the North East. Without such special help many of the ongoing central projects might come to a halt, Jaitley was informed.
Earlier, the special category states mainly the North Eastern states used to get reasonable amount of money under various central government schemes from all successive Governments. Any change in the burden sharing will only add to the liabilities of the states, which they will not be able to meet, leading to dumping of developmental schemes in the region, Jaitley was told."

But the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has criticised the Centre’s decision to leave out the Northeastern region from the MNP gambit.
Addressing a press conference here on the occasion of Digital India week on Monday, BSNL’s North East 1 Circle Chief General Manager DP Singh asserted that he was unhappy with the decision.
“I will fight against it and I will raise the matter with the concerned authorities,” he said.
Pan-India full MNP became a reality on July 3 last.
He pointed out that the  revenue   collection from the circle this year  has gone  up by Rs 17  crore  and assets worth Rs  46  crores have also been added  into the network.
He, however, admitted that the circle also faced a loss of Rs 88 crore this year.
Singh allayed the fears about mobile towers emit radiation creating health hazards.
“Around 25,000 researches have been conducted on the matter in the last three decades and none of the research has come to the conclusion that the radiation affects people’s health,” he said.
Asserting that the Department of Telecom (DoT) has stringent guidelines for radiation emitting from towers, the BSNL official said that there is no cause of alarm with regard to possible ill-effects on human health by electromagnetic field. “Any violation of these guidelines will attract a fine of Rs 10 lakh,” he said.
He also informed that wi-fi  hotspot connectivity would be provided at  some important tourist places. 44 locations of Meghalaya have been selected for this service."
859,"Encroachment issue: M’laya, Assam delegation meet today","Tuesday, July 7, 2015","TURA: A meeting between a delegation from Garo Hills in Meghalaya and Assam comprising of legislators, MDCs and NGO leaders from both sides is set to take place on Tuesday following reports of encroachment by Assam into Meghalaya land as per the revelations made by the Garo Students’ Union recently.
The illegal encroachment is reportedly taking place in the inter-state border areas of Rongsai, Borsora and Pedaldoba villages, all under Dadenggre Civil Sub-Division in West Garo Hills.
According to the Tengsak-led faction of the GSU, the villagers of Pedaldoba are being asked to produce NRC documents and also being threatened on failure to do so by officials from Assam although the village falls under Meghalaya and not under Assam.
“The NRC is a system introduced in Assam to identify illegal immigrants. Our people in Pedaldoba are being asked to produce the same and are threatened or harassed on refusal by the authorities from Assam,” the Union said.
Earlier, a delegation of the Tikrikilla regional unit of the GSU also paid a visit to the said villages and learnt that just recently, earth cutting and filling work being undertaken by the GHADC in preparation for the construction of a weekly market on the Meghalaya side was forcibly halted by ‘mercenaries’ from Assam who claimed that the plot falls under the jurisdiction of Assam.
The Union informed that various development works had also been undertaken by Assam in the same disputed areas including erection of electric poles of the Assam State Electricity Board along the roadsides in the entire Pedaldoba and Borsora region. An Assam ICDS Office has reportedly also been constructed in the same area.
The GSU cited instances of the neighbouring state regularly influencing certain families from Meghalaya to register itself under the Assam Government thereby updating their names under the NRC.
It alleged that many villagers residing in the extreme border areas were registering their names both in Assam and the Meghalaya electoral rolls, thus becoming dual voters which it said, was a major cause for concern.
Another attempt at encroachment by Assam mentioned by the Union include the claim on Meghalaya land by the Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council as being part of its area and erecting its signboards along the Rongsai-Pedaldoba PWD Road.
Meanwhile, stating that this was clear indication of an act of provocation from the Assam side, the Union has sought the intervention of the West Garo Hills deputy commissioner so as to contain the situation from further deterioration.
“A Langpih-like situation is imminent in the mentioned areas if the issue is not solved at the earliest. Tension is brewing and could take an ugly turn which could turn the once peaceful atmosphere into a nightmare. We will not part with even an inch of Meghalaya soil,” the Union warned."

873,The curious case of Sourab Das,"Monday, July 6, 2015","SHILLONG: A ‘ghost’ whistle blower has become an instrument of change in at least compelling the authorities to initiate probes aimed at protecting the forests from further encroachment of cement companies.
One  Sourab Das, Police Point, Near Nazareth Hospital, Laitumkhrah, Shillong-793003 had filed a  complaint against degradation of forest cover in Narpuh Elaka in Jaintia Hills district by  cement companies for using forest without taking forest clearance and violating environmental norms.
Das had sent his complaints to many authorities both at the Centre and the State  including  Union Minister of Environment and  Forests, Chairman, Central Empowered Committee, Leader of Opposition Meghalaya Legislative Assembly, N.E. Regional Office of  Ministry of Environment and Forest, Shillong, Deputy Chief Minister of Meghalaya in charge of Mining and Geology, Principal Chief Conservator of  Forest, Chief  Secretary, Principal Secretary, Mining and Geology, officers of, State Forest Department,  Forest Minister of Meghalaya , Member, National Environment Appellate Authority, Delhi, Dr Sunita Narayan, Director, Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, Green Peace India, Bangalore, and also to certain undisclosed persons at different points of time since November, 2009.
However, the identity of Sourab Das is yet to be revealed even though based on the complaint, the Centre had made queries on the status of the cement plants in Jaintia Hills.
To ascertain the factual position,  the  High Level Committee headed by the then  Principal Secretary of Mining and Geology JP Prakash probed the matter and submitted the report on the cement plants set up in Jaintia Hills to the State  Government on November 25, 2011.
The JP Prakash report had said some cement companies had procured land beyond the required limit even encroaching the forest land violating the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980 and Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.
However, JP Prakash report had to be shelved as an order of Supreme Court on July 6,2011  wanted the sites to be inspected by the State Forest Department along with the Regional Office of MoEF  to authenticate whether the  land used by the cement plants is forest or non-forest.
Later, the first joint inspection committee constituted by the State Government headed by Chief Conservator of Forest, Social Forestry CP Marak and the Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, Regional office, Union Ministry of Environment and Forest, BN Jha in 2012 during their visits in three phases to eight existing cement plants and one proposed plant found out that  many cement companies were occupying forest areas in Jaintia Hills. But the team had left out as many as 1140.426 hectares.
Later, the Second  Joint Inspection Team comprising Dr Anil Kumar, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Central), North East Regional Office, Ministry of Environment and  Forests, Government of India and C P Marak,  Chief Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry and Environment) Meghalaya jointly inspected the land possessed by the cement plants from March 19  to 21, 2013. The team had also found violations of forest laws by the cement plants.
Both the reports of Joint Inspection Teams, copies of which are available with The Shillong Times mentions about the whistle blower Saurab Das whose identity is yet to be known.
“The complainant (Saurab Das)  has never appeared in person either before NE Regional Office, MoEF or State Forest Department. The departments tried to trace out the actual identity of the complainant, but could not find him”, the reports said.
Moreover, a letter from NE Regional Office, MoEF, Shillong was also addressed to the complainant on his address, but the letter returned undelivered as the Post and Telegraph Department could not locate the person on his given address.
The Union Ministry of Environment and Forest, had sought comments/reports of Regional Office, Shillong as well as from the Meghalaya Forest and Environment Department intermittently on the said complaint”, the reports said adding the Central Empowered Committee, New Delhi also desired through letters to decide the status of land used by the cement companies in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court.
A retired forest official who had served at the forest department at Sylvan House, Lower Lachumiere said on Sunday that the department had also written a letter to Saurab Das to personally come to provide more inputs on his complaints, but in vain. Later, police was also sent to trace out Das at the address of” Police Point, Near Nazareth Hospital, Laitumkhrah, Shillong-793003″, but he could not be traced.
There is suspicion that Saurab Das can be a fake name and the complaints in the name of Das may be the handiwork of an insider who is yet to reveal his identity.
Interestingly , the whistle blower in the name of  “Saurav Das, a law graduate and president of an NGO, Ever Green Meghalaya”, had written a letter on June 5, 2012 addressed to the then Chief Justice of Gauhati High Court  A.K. Goel  regarding the misuse of  forest by the cement companies in Jaintia Hills. Following this, the then  Shillong Bench of the Guahati High Court  after treating the letter of Das as a suo-moto PIL, had in an order on July 27 that year, asked the State Government to file an affidavit."

Nurul in his petition filed before the High Court of Meghalaya in 2013 for the anticipatory bail had mentioned that on March 13, 2013, one Adison Sangma, driver of Meghalaya police had given confidential tips to Nurul that some persons were engaged in anti-social activities.
Nurul subsequently passed the information to the district police chief (SP) and the latter had given the order to apprehend the culprits.
“On reaching the temple premises, the petitioner (Nurul) found one Glorina M Marak and a constable in a compromising position. A short distance away, the petitioner also found Glorina’s sister Boilitha in the same condition with one Quinson M Sangma and the third girl was found sitting alone some distance away on a car”, Nurul said in his petition.
According to the petition, Nurul picked up the three girls and the two men and took them to the police station “and General Diary entry  was made regarding the illegal activities”
The petition of Nurul filed before the High Court further said, “Thereafter the SP arrived at the police station and after medical examination, they (two girls) were handed to their father  Randelson CH Marak and the two men were allowed to go with their wives who came to the police station to release them”.
In his petitioner, Nurul had also stated that “the General Diary Entry made in Ampati police station on 13.3.2013 regarding the illegal activities of three girls and two men and their release after medical examination (which will support the facts of the petitioner) is essential for proper adjudication of the case”.

878,KHADC Dy CEM for withdrawal of MUDA notification,"Monday, July 6, 2015","SHILLONG: KHADC Deputy CEM, Process T Sawkmie has urged the Urban Affairs Minister Ampareen Lyngdoh to withdraw notification issued by MUDA over the extension of area by the authority into the areas of the KHADC that has been done without the knowledge of the Council.
It may be recalled that MUDA on January 22 last, had issued a notification which stated- “All types of building constructions within the Shillong Master Plan Area require ‘prior permission’ of the MUDA with immediate effect as the schedule of boundaries”.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, Sawkmie stated that people of Mawlai constituency which he represented are facing great difficulties in view of MUDA notification.
“Many people from my constituency have come to me to air their grievances. As an elected representative, I am deeply concerned over the hue and cry which has resulted in view of the latest notification issued by MUDA,” Deputy CEM said.
He said he was informed that both PHE and MeECL refused to give water and electricity connection unless people produced the occupancy certificate issued by MUDA.
“Personally, I am of the view it is a punishment and harassment for those who wanted to construct their houses,” Sawkmie said.
“Stating that right from the time the State attained its own Statehood in 1972, it is the responsibility of the Hima or the Dorbar Shnong to give the building permission in the scheduled areas”, Deputy CEM said , “It is disheartening to see that there is attempt to interfere with the time tested practice by MUDA,” he said while adding that Meghalaya Building Bye Laws, 2001 emphasized only on the public safety.
He however expressed his happiness to see that statement of Urban Affairs Minister Ampareen Lyngdoh that the State Government did not intent to intrude in the affairs of Scheduled Areas. Earlier, Urban Affairs Minister had made it clear that MUDA has no interest in interfering into areas outside the Municipality. Ampareen added that the State Government would be “more than happy if the KHADC comes up with its own building bye-laws”.
Lyngdoh, however, asserted that there is no alternative authority apart from the Urban Affairs department and the MUDA for monitoring and ensuring safe growth and expansion of urbanization in the State.
“So far the Council does not have a technical wing for issuing permission for construction of residential houses outside the municipal area. The Council has given the liberty to Dorbar Shnong to give NOC for construction of such houses, but we all know that neither the Dorbar Shnong nor the Hima have the technical expertise to ensure that the houses are constructed as per the specified norms,” Ampareen had said adding if  KHADC feels that it has the authority to deal with the issue of urban management, it can shoulder the responsibility in urban areas."

If the footpaths are somehow sustaining beyond their shelf life, then the roads have given up to inferior construction materials and leaking water pipes – a common sight here.
Most footpaths in the city have shed their topping and pedestrians have to be extra cautious while encountering the bumpy skeletal trails now. The roads are no better either since the topping that were given less than a year ago have developed into potholes.
PWD Minister Sniawbhalang Dhar said that there is a need to repair the footpaths as he had also received several complaints. The PWD Minister also said that there is a need to create proper drainage system in city adding that whenever a road is constructed, it must be accompanied with proper drains.
The area near the community water tank in Upland Road, Laitumkhrah is in a dilapidated condition. Here cars, pedestrians and residents have to deal with leaked water pipes right on the middle of the road. The leaking water pipes running underneath this road have eroded the bitumen topping with disbanded hoisted pipes constantly releasing water on this road causing inconveniences to the passersby.
The little school students who cannot jump or stretch like their grown up counterparts over this furrow have to walk through it and often dampen their uniforms and shoes. Some parents are seen pulling their tiny tots by their hand when they approach this middle road furrow.
Mending the water pipes would not help much as movement of vehicles would split them up again. The sight demands an aqueduct solution as seen in other parts of the town. Wanton waste of the precious water is a sorry affair in this road."

SHILLONG: The election to the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council is likely to be held sometime in August before the expiry of the six-month extension granted to the Council in February this year by the State government.
“We will hold the election before the expiry of the six months,” District Council Affairs Minister H.D.R. Lyngdoh said on Friday, while making it clear that the State Government would not grant any more extension to the GHADC term.
It was on January 6 this year that the State Cabinet had recommended extension of term of the GHADC for another six months from February 18.
In fact, the GHADC’s tenure was extended twice in 2014 for six months each as the Government wanted to wait for the amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the constitution to increase the seats from 30 to 40 in GHADC as per the demand of ANVC and ANVC-B.
However, the Union Home Ministry made it clear in the early part of this year that amendment to the Constitution has nothing to do with holding elections in GHADC which compelled the State  Government to initiate the process to hold the election.
The State Government now wants to complete the election at the earliest as it considers the situation in Garo Hills to be favourable for the ruling Congress which is on a high after wresting the Chokpot Assembly seat in the recently-concluded by-election."
900,"Village elder shot dead, cloth merchant abducted in GH","Saturday, July 4, 2015","Tura: Suspected GNLA militants shot dead a fifty-year-old village elder in Kherapara area of West Garo Hills on Friday.
The incident took place at Moropgre village under Gambegre Block when heavily armed militants, suspected to be GNLA, came to the house of Livingstone R Marak and began questioning him.
The militants accused the village elder of being a police informer and despite his denials opened fire killing him on the spot.
Police inform that GNLA commander Hedeo was behind the execution of the village elder and was also involved in the abduction of a cloth merchant, Mundi Prasad, from Bollore weekly market near Gambegre, on the same day.
The merchant was abducted by suspected militants from a Purakhasia-bound Mahindra-pick up mini truck returning from the Bollore weekly market in West Garo Hills on Friday afternoon. The incident took place around 3:30 pm when a group of traders who had gone to Bollore market in the morning to sell their wares was returning to the border village after doing brisk business.
According to reports available, the traders with their loaded wares had just left Bollore village and were preparing to negotiate a climb on the road when eight persons emerged out of the thick undergrowth and stopped the vehicle.
The site of the incident is approximately 5 km from Gambegre development block.
The gang singled out cloth merchant Mundi Prasad (40) of Purakhasia and kept him back while the rest were allowed to carry on with their journey.
Police immediately launched operations in the area to try and flush out the group behind the abduction and till the filing of this report a massive manhunt was underway in the Gambegre area.
The kidnappers’ gang reportedly brandished an AK rifle and pistols when they signalled the vehicle to halt at the desolate spot.
The abducted victim hailed from Purakhasia village itself and regularly visited various village markets to sell his wares. He runs a small but successful cloth shop.
Sources from Purakhasia village reveal that he had previously been served with an extortion note by one of the militant groups operating in the region.
Unconfirmed reports indicate that the gang behind Prasad’s kidnapping was the same involved in the kidnapping of two school teachers, including a village Nokma, a month ago.
School teachers Naresh Koch (50) and Niren Koch (40) of Nokchi border village were travelling on a motorcycle to Halchati for their work when an eight member armed gang took them away and abandoned the two wheeler. Naresh Koch was also the village Nokma of Nokchi.
Naresh subsequently managed to escape from the militants’ custody and surfaced in far away Sibbari border village of south Garo Hills where he took protection inside a BSF outpost.
The Reding T Sangma led ASAK outfit, formed after breaking away from the GNLA, is the prime suspect in the kidnap of the two teachers."

Knowledgeable sources on Friday admitted that there has been no follow up from the government on the matter and things have not moved anywhere.
The pressure groups have asked the government to keep the NPR implementation in the State in abeyance until the issue of illegal influx is sorted out.
The pressure groups have been objecting to implementation of the NPR demanding amendment of certain provisions of it in the wake of the fact that Meghalaya shares borders with Bangladesh and Assam and there are possibilities that people from outside might manage to register themselves and get permanent Indian citizenship.
There have been feeble attempts on the part of the State government to bring the pressure groups on board but no concrete result has been achieved in this regard.
The East Khasi Hills district administration had planned consultative meetings in rural areas of the district to resume Biometric enrolment for the National Population Register (NPR) and had even held some meetings but lack of action from the State government prompted the whole exercise to be put in cold storage."

908,"Ready with the audit report, says KHCF","Saturday, July 4, 2015","SHILLONG: Following allegations that the first edition of the Monolith Festival held in 2013 may have been hit by a major scam, the Khasi Heritage Conservation Forum (KHCF) on Friday clarified that it was ready with the audit report for the fest and had also presented a copy of the same to former KHADC CEM Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit last year.
The statement comes in the wake of the questions being raised over the role of the KHCF for failing to submit the audit report for the first edition of the fest.
“We had presented a copy of the audit report to former KHADC CEM Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit on August 19 last year. The former CEM had also assured that another round of meeting will be called for detailed deliberations on the audit report,” KHCF member secretary Allan West Kharkongor told newsmen here on Friday.
“But since then we never had any meeting even though we waited for it since we wanted to submit the audit report along with proper receipts and vouchers,” the KHCF member secretary claimed.
During the Council’s recently concluded Summer Session, former Deputy CEM Teinwell Dkhar had questioned the KHCF for not submitting the audit report for organizing the first edition of the Monolith Festival even though the expenditures had exceeded Rs 1 crore.
Recalling that the festival was held in October 2013, Dkhar had said that the forum failed to submit the audit report even after nearly two years.
Meanwhile, Kharkongor refuted Dkhar’s claim that Lafarge Umiam Private Limited (LUMPL), which was the main sponsor for the event, paid Rs 30 lakh for the fest.
“Lafarge promised to give Rs 20 lakh only. However, the company paid only Rs 10 lakh as first installment and never paid the remaining amount,” KHCF member secretary claimed.
Kharkongor, however, admitted that the NEC had given Rs 20 lakh towards the festival.
According to him, the forum had also received an amount of Rs 5 lakh from the Art and Culture department of the State Government and Rs 3 lakh from the Tourism department.
“The KHADC had also sanctioned an amount of Rs 20 lakh for organizing of the festival,” he said.
He said that the forum had collected a total amount of Rs 58 lakh from various sources including that sanctioned by the KHADC.
“Despite collecting an amount of Rs 58 lakh, there was shortage of over Rs 21 lakh since the total expenditure for the two day festival was around Rs 79.74 lakh,” the KHCF member secretary said.
“The balance amount of over Rs 21 lakh plus was met by the KHADC. But we have no information of the source of fund,” Kharkongor said.
“We fail to understand why the former Deputy CEM made this wild allegation. We strongly suspect that this is a blatant attempt to sabotage the image of the forum members,” the KHCF member secretary said while asserting that Dkhar should have got his facts right before making the comments.
He further maintained that the KHCF will make clear that there is no financial irregularity involved in organizing the first edition of the Monolith Festival."

910,Assam villagers ‘stake claim’ over Meghalaya land in Garo Hills,"Saturday, July 4, 2015","TURA: Another case of Assam staking claim to land belonging to Meghalaya has come to light in Garo Hills.
According to the GSU, the inter-state border areas of Rongsai, Borsora and Pedaldoba villages under Dadenggre Civil Sub-Division in West Garo Hills are witness to the alleged illegal activities of the villagers from the neighbouring state.
A delegation of the GSU recently paid a visit to the said villages and learnt that the earth cutting and filling work being undertaken by the GHADC in preparation for the opening of a weekly market on the Meghalaya side was forcibly halted by people from Assam who claimed that the plot fell under the jurisdiction of their State.
The union also claimed that Assam has undertaken various developmental works in the same disputed areas including erection of electric poles of the Assam State Electricity Board along roadsides in the entire Pedaldoba and Borsora region. An Assam ICDS Office has reportedly also been constructed in the same area.
The GSU cited instances of the neighbouring state regularly influencing certain families from Meghalaya to register under the Assam Government by updating their names under the NRC. It alleged that many villagers residing in the extreme border areas were registering their names both in Assam and the Meghalaya electoral rolls, thus becoming dual voters.
The union urged the State Government to look into the matter."

925,Demand for CBI probe into cop’s death,"Friday, July 3, 2015","SHILLONG: With the delay in the probe by Special Investigation Team into the mysterious death of police officer P.J. Marbaniang and with no arrests, there is a demand for a CBI probe to unravel the truth behind the crime.
In statement issued to the media on Tuesday, the CSWO has said that there is a need to have a CBI inquiry to unravel the truth.
According to CSWO president, Agnes Kharshiing, the Police officer was shot dead after firing bullet from the back of the head in the premises of the Patharkhmah Police Outpost in his quarters and no arrests have been made so far.
“Prima facie the clothes of the slain officer are missing and according to R. Kalita who is a constable of the Patharkhmah Outpost, the GNRC had cut the clothes and thrown them in the dustbin. In addition to tampering of evidence this is also an insult and dishonor to the uniform. The staff in GNRC who has destroyed the clothes and evidence should have been booked as per law, Kharshiing said.
The police official from Meghalaya, S. Umdor, who was Officer in Charge Nongpoh, Ri Bhoi District, who was present in the GNRC on the wee hours of 25.1.2015, as informed by sources to the CSWO, did not take back the clothes to be preserved and produced as evidence.
“He should immediately be arrested as the same officer who was appointed initially as the IO of the case, allowed the crime scene which is within the Police campus, to be tampered with,” Kharshiing alleged.
The CSWO said it has found out discrepancies between the two medical doctors, one of the CHC and the one conducting the post-mortem, which had compelled the Home department to set up the (Special Investigation Team) SIT.
The wound in one of the examination was measured by a measuring tape and not by a ruler as is the procedure and this was stated by one of the FSL groups from Shillong to the SIT Team, who had gone to the crime scene in February after the place of crime was cleaned.
Kharshiing further pointed out that no post mortem was conducted in Assam and Magistrate’s sanction was not taken to carry body outside the State without a post mortem, which should have been the procedure, especially when the case was treated as a Medico legal case.
The GD entry at Dispur was made only at 4 am though immediately on bringing the body at 12.25 am on the 25.1.2015, information was sent to the Police station at Dispur, from GNRC. The policeman sent from Dispur was one Kalita.
“This case, where the officer was shot from the back of the head (as indicated by the FSL team member from Shillong) was treated as a UD (unnatural death) case and registered as Nongpoh UD case No 4/2015 on January 27.
The Dispur Police had also informed the CSWO that there was an SP who had come to the Dispur Police station. “Who is that SP?” the CSWO wanted to know.
Moreover, the first Investigating Officer, the DSP or SP did not ask the FSL team to come at the first instance, and instead allowed the tampering of a crime scene, Kharshiing said.
The wounds were being deliberately measured by tape to confuse the entry and exit wounds, Kharshiing, said, adding that the police present at the Patharkhmah Police outpost took half an hour to take a person who sustained gunshot wounds to the nearest CHC which is a stone’s throw away from the outpost and the police officer’s quarter.
According to Kharshiing, since suspicion is on an inside job, the police personnel allegedly involved in the crime should have been arrested."

When referred to the recent letter of Syiem of Mylliem where he stated that the decision to convert the area into a Reserved Forest needs to be reviewed, Kharpuri said it was to discuss this that the Syiem of Mylliem was summoned.
“We will not backtrack from the earlier decision to declare the Law Syiem as protected forest,” she said while recalling that the Hima and the Council had already signed an agreement on this.
It may be mentioned that on May 22 last year, Mylliem Syiemship represented by the Syiem and the Myntris had entered into an agreement with the KHADC represented by the CEM and EM Forest to jointly manage the Pine Forest and convert it into a ‘Law Adong’ (Reserved Forest).

To a question, Syiem refused to divulge any information related to the progress of the inquiry saying that the report is on the verge of completion.
Syiem also asserted there was no pressure from any quarters as far as the investigation of the high profile case is concerned as he insisted that the only aim of the team is to find out the truth.
The discrepancies in the medical and post-mortem reports and the version of the doctor had compelled the Home department to set up  SIT.
The Ri Bhoi police had initially claimed that it was a suicide case, but police later registered it as a murder case.
What caused concern for police was that the crime scene was allegedly disturbed and evidences were destroyed. Prior to the formation of SIT the Ri Bhoi district police chief  had deputed S. Umdor, Officer in-charge of Nongpoh PS, to carry out investigation. Later another investigation was carried out by J. Rymmai, Commandant of the Sixth MLP Battalion."

“The police in Bajengdoba and the Forest Department personnel are allowing the smugglers to export the produce for a substantial bribe,” accused the GNLA and criticised the student bodies GSU and FKJGP for their inaction in this regard.
“We call upon the Garo NGOs to come forward and fight this menace for the future of Garo Hills because we in the GNLA will not allow this destruction of our forests to continue,” warned Garo Mandai Ch Marak.

When the case came up before the Division Bench of High Court of Meghalaya on Tuesday, the lawyer on behalf of Income Tax department sought three weeks to file reply.
During the last hearing on June 16, the Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Uma Nath Singh, and    Justice SR Sen asked the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Shillong, to file affidavit indicating as to whether the Income Tax Department is charging income tax on the income earned from the source situated in Municipal Area, Shillong, from the tribal population staying in the Municipal area and if not, the reasons there for.
The Court wanted to know why  tax is not charged from the tribals who are also the residents of the Municipal area and “who are said to amass and possess the maximum wealth, and control almost 90% of sources of income of Meghalaya to the disadvantage of poor natives settled in the semi-urban and the rural areas.

957,Chokpot goes to Cong,"Wednesday, July 1, 2015","Blow for Purno, GNC lDeborah credits party workers for victory
TURA: The ruling Congress in Meghalaya on Tuesday gave a shock defeat to the Opposition parties by snatching the Chokpot seat after a gap of over 15 years.
Congress candidate and widow of former MLA Masonsing Sangma, Bluebell R Sangma, defeated her nearest opponent of NPP by a margin of 2,550 votes.
The victory in Chokpot is of immense value to the Congress not just because it brings the party to the half-way mark in the 60-member state assembly (30) but also because it was the cradle for the movement of a separate Garoland state nurtured for decades by former GNC leader Clifford R Marak whose untimely death on February 28 last necessitated the by-election.
Late Marak’s widow, Kalpana D Sangma, who took on the leadership mantle of the GNC and joined the fray fell by the wayside coming a distant third.
The results couldn’t have come at a  worse time for the Congress’s bête noire Purno A Sangma of the National Peoples’ Party (NPP) which was hoping to make a major comeback in the state after being literally swept away by the Congress Tsunami of 2013 when it barely hung on to just two assembly seats in Garo Hills- – Dadenggre and Songsak.
The NPP had given its all in this election hoping to create a wave the ripples of which would have reached Delhi and Modi. Clearly the voters thought otherwise.
When counting began on Tuesday morning it was the Congress all the way and by the end of the sixth and last round of counting Congress had secured a total of 8,042 votes while nearest rival of NPP was way behind with a total of 5,492.
It was the GNC candidate and Marak’s widow Kalpana D Sangma who came very close to overtaking the NPP for the runners-up position. The GNC candidate received 5009 votes in her favour. She also overtook the NPP pushing it to third position during the first and second round of counting but ultimately had to settle for the No. 3 position when the counting was completed. The lone Independent candidate Tinkerwin R Marak secured a mere 1189 votes while the number of voters who pressed on the NOTA button (Non Of The Above) were 424.The Chokpot election, held on Saturday, recorded an 83.11 percent turnout from among the 24,244 electorate.
Deborah hails victory: Meanwhile, Congress working president of Meghalaya and Social Welfare Minister Deborah Marak has lauded her party workers for their ‘dedicated’ and ‘hard work’ which helped their candidate Bluebell Sangma to emerge victorious in the Chokpot by-election. “We had expected a good fight with our opponent from the NPP and our grassroot workers and everyone within the party worked hard to ensure victory. They (grassroot workers) are the most deserving of this victory,” said Deborah Marak.
She added that people of Chokpot wanted to give the Congress a chance after witnessing the law and order situation and the backwardness of the region."
958,"Two widows fight it out, one victorious","Wednesday, July 1, 2015","TURA: Both female candidates who fought the Chokpot by-election were victims of tragedy while their late spouses were in the prime of their political carrier.
Victorious Congress candidate Bluebell R Sangma was the wife of Masonsing M Sangma when he was the sitting NCP MLA of Chokpot. Masonsing Sangma died of a massive heart attack in 2012, just months before Meghalaya went to the polls.
She went on to unsuccessfully contest on the NCP ticket despite her late husband’s plans to fight from Purno’s newly created NPP  in the 2013 state elections.
In the case of Kalpana D Sangma, her husband Clifford Marak was the sitting MLA of Chokpot. But less than two years later he passed away. It is interesting to note that the Chokpot assembly seat alternatively changed hands between Late Masonsing Sangma and Late Clifford Marak almost every five years for more than a decade and a half."

962,Teilinia quits without facing floor test,"Wednesday, July 1, 2015","SHILLONG: Teilinia Thangkiew became the first KHADC chairperson to resign on the floor of the House following a two-hour debate on the no-confidence motion raised against her by the ruling coalition (PDF) on the last day of the Council’s Summer Session on Tuesday.
Thangkhiew had scripted history by becoming the first woman chairperson of the Council on March 6 last year.
Speaking during the debate before submitting her resignation, Thangkhiew said that she has decided to resign on the floor of the House since it is understood that the PDF will not withdraw the resolution to move a no-confidence motion against her.
“I am tendering my resignation under Rule 11 (b) of the Assam and Meghalaya Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Council) Rules, 1951,” she said while submitting her resignation letter to Deputy Chairman Gabriel Wahlang.
“I decided to face this resolution of no-confidence since I wanted to resign on the floor of the House. I knew well that the numbers were against me. But I am happy that I been able to resign from the place where I was elected,” Thangkhiew said.
Earlier, the Opposition MDCs sought justification for the resolution moved by the ruling coalition especially in view of the fact that CEM Pynshngaiñ N Syiem had admitted that Thangkhiew was efficient enough for the post.
Interestingly, the ruling coalition could not justify its decision to move the no-confidence motion and the same was apparent from the body language of the PDF MDCs on the floor of the House who seemed to have taken the decision due to political compulsions. While participating in the discussion on the resolution, Opposition Leader Metbah Lyngdoh said that there is no valid ground to remove the present chairperson.
“In the past one year, the chairperson has proved her efficiency and competency in conducting the business of the House,” he said.
Participating in the resolution, HSPDP MDC KP Pangniang also urged the EC to allow the present chairperson to continue. Echoing similar views, former KHADC chief, Ardent M Basaiawmoit said, “We are not fighting for power but we are highlighting the efficiency, courage and qualities of the incumbent chairperson.”
While stating that the post of a chairperson is like the post of the Speaker in the Parliament, he said, “Specific reasons should be put forward before removing anybody holding such a post. The PDF has failed to do so.”
Interestingly, from the ruling side, only NCP MDC Sanbor Shullai stood up to acknowledge the efficiency of the chairperson. “I appreciate Thangkhiew personally for her efficiency,” Shullai said adding that he feels like opposing the resolution moved against her but cannot since he is part of the ruling PDF and has decided to leave the matter to the wisdom of the Deputy Chairman.
Defending the move, Congress MDC (Jirang) Victor Ranee said that the PDF decided to move the no confidence resolution to ensure that the present executive committee remains intact and lasts till the end of this term.
Refuting the allegations levelled by the Opposition that the resolution moved was to disrespect women, Rani said, “Since the new EC was formed with the support of the Congress, NCP and Independents, allotment of portfolios was already decided upon. The decision is to accommodate Manstudy Nongrem, a senior member in the PDF led coalition.” Justifying further, KHADC chief Pynshngainlang N Syiem said, “We have clearly stated in our resolution that we have nothing against the incumbent chairperson.” Stating that the decision was a compulsion that arose after the formation of the new executive committee, Syiem said, “We have come to a stage where we have to consider the interest and collective opinion of all members in the ruling coalition.”
Meanwhile, the KHADC Executive Committee formally sent the resignation of Council chairperson Teilinia Thangkhiew to the District Council Affairs department on Tuesday. Sources informed that in the letter addressed to the DCA, the Council has proposed that the election of the new chairman should be held on July 9. According to sources, Governor V Shanmuganathan will notify the date of the election of the new chairman."

972,"Chief Secy releases training manual, guidelines on Eri Silk","Wednesday, July 1, 2015","Shillong: GIZ in collaboration with Directorate of Sericulture has produced a training manual and general guidelines on how to produce better quality, smoother, finer Eri Silk yarn.
GIZ had been working with several women at Umden, Ri Bhoi over the last two years and training women to be more innovative with their designs.
GIZ has been working with the women weavers and had brought in their experts to train several batches of women. Making a presentation to the audience, Kenneth Pala, Senior Technical Expert said earlier Eri Silk products were woven for traditional purposes. There was no standardization in terms of size, dyeing process and method. Finished products did not fly off the shelves as they were rough in texture and the design, shape and style did not match consumer demands.
Pala said GIZ helped to give Eri more silky features and leading to product diversification with better quality and consistency. He said that earlier people of Ri Bhoi sold their cocoons to Assam but today there is a demand for cocoons leading to demands for training of master trainers from different districts of the State.
Sabine Preuss, Programme Director, IGEPRA, Delhi, who was present for the release of the two books, said she had visited the villages in Ri Bhoi and was happy to see that GIZ had helped to improve the livelihoods of people and also to better adapt to climate change.
“I was surprised at the technical skills of the women involved in weaving. I am also very encouraged by the cooperation of the Government of Meghalaya. Together we can blend the social, technical, organizational, business and marketing aspects to empower the women to upscale their livelihoods,” Preuss said.
Dr. Uwe Scholz, Project Director, GIZ, NE Region, said he was happy that the Organisation had delivered good inputs for which about 7000 households in Ri Bhoi district would be benefitted.
“We will help link the women to international markets where these niche products are in demand and we hope that the private sector will take up this business in right earnest, Dr Scholz said.
Chief Secretary, P.B.O. Warjri who released the two books, said that Meghalaya had planned six years ago to tackle climate change and to adapt to that change in several sectors such as health, sericulture, environment etc. Warjri said Meghalaya had tied up with KFW the German Bank six years ago but GIZ has overtaken them. KFW is yet to start any project in Meghalaya, he said.
“There is definite improvement and change in the quality of yarn and the finished products. Now choices are made available to weavers and Eri Silkworm growers. This is one step towards the adaptation method. The Sericulture Department too has been working very hard and now we are discovering issues that can be sorted out and areas to improve upon. I am sure that in another year we will have better products,” Warjri stated.
Twenty women weavers from Umden were present at the function held at the office of Meghalaya Basin Development Authority. All of them had made professional visiting cards with in an effort to connect with future clients."

Also citing the reason behind the delay in submitting the proposal for 2014-2015, he however said this is because two of the MDCs including HDR Lyngdoh from Sohiong-Nongspung constituency and Latiplang Kharkongor from Nongthymmai constituency are yet to submit their proposals.

982,‘Statistics an important tool for diagnosing and correcting socio-economic problems’,"Tuesday, June 30, 2015","Shillong: June 29, the birthday of Prof. C. Mahalonobis, the pioneer in statistical studies in this country, is observed as National Statistics Day in India.
In Shillong, the National Sample Survey Office (FOD) and the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, Shillong Regional Office, organized a programme in the MUDA complex to observe the 122nd birth anniversary of Prof. Mahalonobis. Students of Seven Set Higher Secondary School and Christian Academy were invited as participants to the programme. For the students this was a first ever invitation to a forum where they were allowed to share their views.
Having been forewarned about the theme of the day’s observance, Importance of statistics in social development the students came armed with interesting facts about why statistics which is famously labeled as ‘lies, damned lies and statistics’ by Mark Twain is actually imperative for understanding every facet of human behavior and providing correctives for policy formulation.
Dr. Vishnu Kant Srivastava, DDG, NSSO (FOD) in his keynote address gave a brief outline of the life of Prof. Mahalonobis and how his life was a series of coincidences which all added up to making him the pioneer of statistical studies in India. He informed the young audience that Prof. Mahalonobis who had the ear of then Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru has proposed in the Second Five Year Plan that India should go in for rapid industrialization.
“Prof. Mahalonobis was so dedicated to this subject that he bought four acres of land in Kolkata in 1931 on which now stands the famous Indian Statistical Institute,” Dr Srivastava informed.
Speaking as chief guest at the function, Editor, The Shillong Times, Patricia Mukhim, emphasized on the importance of correct statistics for policy making and interventions by various agencies and government. She pointed out that statistics could also be manipulated by certain agencies which have a vested interest.
She pointed to the statistics of 70,000 child labourers in what is now East Jaintia Hills with a total population of 1.22 lakh people which was produced by a local NGO and created quite a stir.
“According to this statistics nearly a half of the population of East Jaintia Hills are child labourers which is preposterous,” Mukhim said. She also stated that the State had very poor socio-economic indicators in the area of health particularly in maternal and infant mortality.
In his presentation, Dr. B. Dasgupta, Asstt. Director, Directorate of Census Operations made a stunning remark that the reason for Meghalaya’s high birth rate (highest fertility ratio in the country) has a positive correlation to high infant mortality, apart from poor nutrition and inadequate pre and post natal care.
“If we can check the high infant mortality rate and ensure better survival through multiple interventions, the birth rate too would come down,” Dasgupta said adding that high growth rate is also more prevalent among the poor.
Commenting on Meghalaya’s water and sanitation status, Dasgutpa said, “It is appalling.”
Dasgupta stated that only 39.3 % of Meghalaya’s population has tap water while 25.4% use well water and 19% spring water as a source for drinking water. He informed that out of 5.38 lakh households in Meghalaya 34 % defecate openly while 23.3 % use pit latrines thereby leading to water borne diseases.
Dasgupta also informed the audience that worker participation ratio in Meghalaya between 2001-2011 has come down from 43% to 39% and said that more people are unemployed today and have no employment opportunities. This he said has led to lower consumption levels which is an indicator that poverty level is rising in Meghalaya.
In the interaction, facilitated by S. Nongkynrih, NSSO officer, the students said they were enlightened by the deliberations and have realized the importance of statistics as a subject of study.
Some even suggested that Statistics should be included as a subject at the high school level.
They also asked pointed questions from the resource persons.
The organizers, however, lamented that the media did not seem to realize the importance of statistics in the social development of the state and country."

Dkhar claimed that Forum had managed to collect a substantial amount of fund for organizing the Festival through donations from government department and private companies including individuals.
He revealed that the Forum had received a whooping amount of Rs.30 lakh from Lafarge Cement company and another Rs.20 lakh from the North Eastern Council.
“Besides this, the KHADC had also sanctioned Rs.20 lakh for the Festival. I have no information on the amount of fund the Council had collected from other sources despite being the Executive Member in charge of Art and Culture department which was responsible for organizing the Festival,” Dkhar said while moving a cut motion in the House on Monday.
The Forum was headed by former Sohra MDC Titosstarwell Chyne as chairman and local entrepreneur Allan West Kharkongor as member secretary to mobilize funds for hosting the Festival.
Alleging that the Forum had failed to pay the charges of the consultation firm which was engaged in the construction of the Khasi Heritage Village project at Mawphlang, the UDP MDC said that the Forum’s inability to submit the audit report could be an indication of a ‘major scam’.
Dkhar also suggested that the KHADC Executive Committee should not organize the second edition of the Festival until and unless the present controversy is resolved.
In his reply, EM in charge Art and Culture, Antonio War, informed that the EC was awaiting the audit report from KHCB pertaining to the first Monolith Festival held at the Heritage Village at the famous Mawphlang Sacred groves.
Stating that everything will be clear once the audit report reaches the Council, War said, “It was only last week that the KHCB member secretary Allan West had come to meet the department and assured that the report would be submitted within this week.”
Mentioning that he might not be able to comment any further on the issue, War assured the House that the EC would dispose of the matter at the earliest."

“The amount is too meagre. If the amount is divided among the 30 MDCs each will get only Rs.10,000 as relief in the event of a natural calamity in our constituency,” Kharkongor said while taking part in a cut motion on Monday.
He also suggested that the KHADC should strengthen the Taxation department to prevent leakage of taxes.
“It is necessary to pluck the leakages in the payment of professional tax especially when the KHADC has been badly hit in view of the NGT ban on coal mining,” he said.
According to Kharkongor, several KHADC employees were sitting idle and drawing their salaries at the end of the month. “Their services can be utilized to collect professional taxes,” he added.
UDP MDC Teinwell Dkhar questioned the budgetary allocation for the Fisheries department as there has been no output from the department till date.
Dkhar also alleged that the Water Resource department was involved only in cleaning the Wahumkhrah and sought to know details of other project taken up by the department in various localities.
In his reply to the cut motion brought by the Opposition, EM in charge Finance, Neil Antonio War, said that in the financial year 2013-14 only Rs.35,000 was utilized for natural calamities.
In 2014-15 out of the Rs.3 lakh provided under the head ‘natural calamities’ not a single penny was spent, he informed.
“We hope that this year we will be free of natural calamities and if there is any claim the EC will examine the claims of the individual MDCs,” War said.
On the issue of professional tax, the EM, while saying that it was bringing maximum revenue, opposed the idea of burdening the Council with creation of additional posts.
War also informed the House that the Fisheries department had received Rs.1.50 lakh as budget provision in 2013-14 and Rs.5 lakh in 2014-15 but there was no utilization of the funds. “Considering this the allocation for 2015-16 has been pruned to Rs.1 lakh,” War informed."

996,Heritage Village in shambles; KHADC caught napping,"Monday, June 29, 2015","SHILLONG: The Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) might be harping on the huge success and popularity of the Monolith Festival held at Mawphlang in 2013 and has come up with plans to organise the second edition of the event with a 100 per cent hike in the fund allocation, but a reality check of the assets already created at the Khasi Heritage Village at Mawphlang which had come up during the 2013 edition of the Festival, paints a very different picture.
The much-publicized inauguration of the Khasi Heritage Village project in a sprawling eight-acre plot of land at Mawphlang which was initiated by the erstwhile Congress-led Executive Committee of Khasi Hills United Democratic Alliance (KHUDA) and sanctioned by the 13th Finance Commission at an estimated cost of Rs 5.90 crore, is in shambles.
Sources said that out of the total allocation of Rs.5.90 crore, the contractor for the project was paid only Rs.2.80 crore forcing the contractor to discontinue the work.
Out of 17 traditional huts of the various Himas planned at the site, only 10 were actually constructed.
During a recent visit to the Heritage Village, it was found that several huts were badly damaged and most of the wooden furniture were broken.
“The Heritage Village was conceptualized to attract tourists, but organising the Monolith Festival once a year and leaving the assets created as part of the project un-attended throughout the year will bring additional burden to the KHADC in terms of maintenance,” sources added. Though two staffs were appointed by the KHADC to look after the project, they claimed that it was beyond them to man the entire eight acre plot of land all by themselves.
The first and the only edition of the Monolith Festival was organised at the Heritage Village site in October, 2013. The Festival was inaugurated by the then Union Tribal Affairs Minister V Kishore Chandra Deo.
The expenditure incurred for the Festival was around Rs.20 lakh. The festival was meant to be an annual affair.
“The KHADC paid Rs.20 lakh to the Khasi Heritage Conservation Forum for holding the two-day Festival from October 25, 2013. Sohra legislator Titus Chyne was the Chairman of the Forum while Alan West was the Secretary,” the official source said.
When questions were raised on the manner in which funds were spent for the Heritage Village project, the then KHADC CEM Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit had ordered an inquiry into the matter.
Ardent had stated that people had the right to know why the KHADC EC had failed to invite open tender for appointment of consultants and also the lack of transparency in the construction of public toilets worth Rs.32 lakh in the Heritage Village.
The proposed second Monolith Festival could not be held in 2014 due to the pending allegations.
The outcome of the inquiry into the allegations is yet to be made public though the inquiry officer has already submitted the report.
With a change of guard in the KHADC now, the ruling Congress-led PDF is planning to hold the second Monolith Festival this year by increasing the fund allocation to Rs. 40 lakh for the four-day event.
Incidentally, Basaiawmoit has questioned the decision of the EC to hike the fund allocation for the second edition of the Festival."
997,City school head issues false receipt,"Monday, June 29, 2015","SHILLONG: A city based school headmaster is in the docks for allegedly issuing a ‘false’ receipt against a transfer certificate (TC) to a former pupil of the school.
Biswajit Goswami, Headmaster of Ramakrishna Mission Upper Primary School (RKMUPS), Umsohsun, now faces stern action from the Ramakrishna Mission, Cherrapunjee which manages the school.
The alleged fraud came to light when one Rinku Ghosh, a former student of RKMUPS, now settled in Assam, asked her brother Kamalesh Ghosh in Shillong to collect her TC from the school as she required the same for registration in the ongoing process of NRC (National Register of Citizens) in Assam.
Her brother, who visited the school along with a companion – who is a teacher in an LP school in the city – alleged that the headmaster initially demanded Rs.500 for the TC.
On objection, the rate came down to Rs.300. The headmaster reasoned that he has been asked by Ramakrishna Mission, Cherrapunjee to charge this rate.
Meanwhile, Swami Anuragananda Maharaj, Secretary, Ramakrishna Mission, Cherrapunjee, confirmed over phone that the receipt issued by the Headmaster was false since the school does not charge any fees for issue of TC.
“We do not charge our students anything for education in our school. Here everything is free. The said receipt issued by the Headmaster   is false since the school name on the receipt does not match with the actual name of the school. This amounts to demanding bribe and manipulation. We will initiate strict action against the headmaster,” the Secretary said, while adding that the school is a UP School and not a Secondary School as indicated in the receipt.
The name of the school in the false receipt reads Ramakrishna Mission LP/UP/Secondary School with No. 27277 dated 26/06/2015 and has the official logo of Ramakrishna Mission."

1007,Ostracised woman stranded in a state of hopelessness,"Monday, June 29, 2015","SHILLONG: She had to leave her house along with her nine-year-old daughter in March after the local dorbar ostracized her for allegedly practicing witchcraft. If this was not enough, 40-year-old Yoris Khongjoh of Sankhat village, Muktapur under Amlarem Sub Division, West Jaintia Hills is still being threatened.
The accusers allegedly threatened to burn Khongjoh’s house, cut her water supply and forbid from using public transport. All this left her with no choice but to abandon the village along with her minor daughter Rikynti Khongjoh.
CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing claimed that the woman had bought a piece of land prior to the birth of her child, which was later encroached upon by one Bless Syrti. After the woman resisted the encroachment, Syrti went to the Dorbar which summoned Khongjah on March 25 and decided to ostracize her alleging she was practicing witchcraft.
Kharshiing alleged that one Bolai Das from Bangladesh, the ex-husband of Khongjoh is also suspected to be behind the ostracisation charges leveled against her.
“Das is friendly with Hedrick Dhar, the village headman and Elwis Khongiong, the secretary and one Long Dhar who have time and again threatened to kill Khongjoh,” the CSWO said.
The victim lodged a complaint on June 27 that the four persons,  Headrick Dkhar, Long Dkhar, Elwis Khongiong and  Bolai Das alleged her of practicing witchcraft, threatened her with dire consequences and also chased her out of the village.
After the first incident in March, the CSWO president had called up the Sub Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of Amlarem who assured to take up the matter. On April 1, Khongjoh was called to sign a “peace bond” at Amlarem. She signed it considering that the village heads would be pacified by the intervention of the SDM.
However, when she went back to the village in mid-June, she was threatened with dire consequences yet again by men who had gathered in the house of Bolai Das.
This forced her to flee along with her daughter.
Concerned over the series of cases of ostracism, the CSWO has asked the Government to initiate steps to contain the matter."

1009,Land acquisition hurdles hurting expansion plans,"Monday, June 29, 2015","SHILLONG: Land acquisition hurdles continue to remain the biggest factor responsible for the failure of the proposed road-expansion projects in the city which is now more congested than ever.
East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner Sanjay Goyal said that though there are some proposals for expansion of roads and construction of fly-overs in the city, problems in land acquisition and exchange mar the efforts.  He further informed that the District Administration wanted to exchange land with the Defence authorities for a particular project and even land was identified near Happy Valley for the same but the talks eventually proved unsuccessful.
The District Administration, however, has now identified a land near Umiam for the Defence authorities and necessary inspection is going on for the exchange of land.
Lack of expansion options is choking Shillong by the day. Several observers including senior government officials feel that despite Shillong being blessed with even terrain in major portions of the city, it could not be greatly taken advantage of to develop the infrastructure due to the peculiar land tenure system in the State. A huge chunk of land that remain with the Defence authorities inside the city and its outskirts have also complicated things. “There were many attempts to de-congest Shillong. Many proposals and plans were formulated for expanding city roads and constructing flyovers but no such plan ever materialized,” said an observer."

With a spurt in cases of ostracization and punishment to people in the name of practicing witchcraft, the Village Administration Bill, if implemented, has provisions to check these aberrations.
The Village Administration Bill under section 5 (B) on Prohibitions states that the “Dorbar Shnong and the Rangbah Shnong of the village shall not in any form or in manner arbitrarily decide or act or impose or condone or incite rumors of witchcraft, sorcery or any practice of black magic against any person, individual or any inhabitants or households of the village”.

“The Dorbar cannot allow any kinds of allegations to spiral out of control among inhabitants or households of the village,” the Bill states.
Traditional bodies cannot condone or comply with any kinds of violent acts that may cause harm or loss of life of any inhabitants or households of the village.
Besides, the Bill also bars headmen from ‘encouraging, initiating, complying with or condoning any kind of injustice or destruction of property or acts of violence against inhabitants or households on basis of rumours or allegations’."

1017,Tussle between 2 depts hits limestone export,"Sunday, June 28, 2015","SHILLONG: Different orders by the departments of Mining and Geology and Forest and Environment on the nature of weighing of limestone and boulders has led to an impasse resulting in halt to export of the minerals to Bangladesh from the land custom station (LCS) at Dawki in West Jaintia Hills.
While the Mining and Geology department was in favour of volumetric measurement, the forest department insisted that the mineral should be weighted at the weighbridge.
Customs was also in favour of volumetric measurement.
While exporters preferred volumetric measurement of limestone,  annoyed over the stand of exporters, the forest department stopped the export of limestone.
Another reason for objecting to weighing of limestone and boulder  at the existing weighbridge at Dawki is that it can handle only 150 numbers of trucks per day whereas the number of limestone/boulder stone laden trucks passing through Dawki LCS is 812 per day.
Initially, the export of limestone was stalled two months back after the War Jaintia Lime Stone/ Boulder Stone Exporters Miners Association (WJLBEMA) opposed the decision of the government to weigh the items in weighbridge.
The tussle has not only affected the exporters but also the miners.
Following the objection raised by the WJLBEMA, the Mining and Geology department had given the permission to allow the weighing of limestone and boulders through volumetric method in accordance with the report submitted by the Fact Finding Team (FTT) which had made an assessment on the feasibility of  weighbridge ( at Dawki.
In the letter addressed to the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) of North Eastern Region on June 10, the Mining and Geology department secretary W Khyllep had said that the measurement of the limestone should be by way of volumetric method to determine the weight of the consignment such as limestone/boulder stone exported to Bangladesh even as the letter stated that similar method is adopted in Bangladesh side also.
Khyllep said that the weighbridge at Dawki cannot handle large number of trucks.
“The existing weighbridges at the export points are made operational under the orders of the NGT for compulsory weighing of coal being exported to Bangladesh,” Khyllep added.
Taking cognizance of the letter issued by the Mining and Geology department, the office of the Commissioner of Customs (Preventive) passed an order on June 19 saying that the limestone and boulders will  be allowed for export on volumetric method of measurement only for Land Custom Stations located in the State still such time weighbridges are installed by the State Government.
Talking to newsmen here on Saturday, WJLBEMA spokesperson Dolly Khonglah said that they had gone to the Forest and Environment check gate at Dawki to inquire if they can resume the export of limestone on June 20 based on the orders received from Mining and Geology department as well as the Customs department, but in vain as the reply from the forester at the check gate was to wait.
The District Forest Officer at Jowai also gave the same reply .
“We waited for two days (June 22 and 23) and yet there was no response from the forest department,” Khonglah said, adding that the  Customs officials deputed at the LCS finally allowed the export of limestone’s on June 25 after the Forester failed to provide a written order. The customs had allowed over 30 trucks to transport limestone.
The  Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Jaintia hills Territorial Division, Jowai issued an order on June 25, declaring the export challans of 14 exporters as invalid and again on  June 26, the DFO issued another order whereby all export challans were declared invalid."

“We are not afraid of getting arrested for following the order of the Government,” WJLBEMA spokesperson Dolly Khonglah told newsmen here on Saturday.
Khonglah was reacting to reports that appeared in a section of the media about the Forest Minister threatening to get the exporters arrested for illegally resuming the export of limestone to Bangladesh.
While condemning the statement, she also challenged the Minister to prove the exporters guilty.
“On what grounds are we to be punished? Is the Minister saying that the order of the Mining and Geology Department is invalid? We have exported limestone since there was no written order from the Forest Department to counter the order of Mining and Geology Department,” the WJLBEMA spokesperson said
Stating that exporters are complying with the orders issued by the Mining & Geology department and Customs, Khonglah further questioned as to why the order of the Forest department was applicable only at Dawki LCS and not at other stations like Bagli and Shella.
“We are not criminals but  revenue earners of the state and the country,” she said while maintaining that the exporters have done no wrong and will fight for their rights.

A win for the State Congress in the Chokpot by-election would do wonders to improve the party’s image in Garo Hills considering that the State Government has drawn severe flak for the worsening law and order situation in Garo Hills due to the spurt in violent activities of militant groups.
A Congress leader on Friday admitted that securing Chokpot seat will be a boost to the party.    Things are no different for the Purno Sangma-led NPP which is also hoping for a reversal of its fortunes with a win for its candidate Phillipole D Marak in Chokpot. An additional seat for the NPP will rejuvenate the party which currently has only two legislators – James Sangma and Nihim D Shira.
The Chokpot by-poll will also prove be a big test for the Garo National Council (GNC) as the outcome is likely to decide the future of the party in the State.
GNC candidate Kalpana D Sangma, wife of late Clifford Marak, whose death necessitated the by-election in Chokpot, has projected herself to be the face of the party which has been spearheading the movement for a separate Garo state.
A win for Clifford’s widow in Chokpot will prove to be crucial for the GNC to stay afloat."

Mahanta to withdraw from the post considering that a building at Lachumiere, owned by his wife, has figured among those constructed in violation of the prescribed norms of MUDA.
The written order posted on the High Court website, after the hearing on the high rise building on June 18, said that during the course of the hearing, Mahanta said that earlier the MUDA byelaws were applied only in a loose manner and thus even some residential buildings were permitted to be raised beyond the prescribed height.
Mahanta further said that in his locality also, there may be as many as 25 buildings which can be said to be in violation of the byelaws.
“A house in the name of his wife may also come within the purview of limited violations but he assures that he would immediately comply with the Court’s orders if any, passed in respect of that building,” the court order stated.
The court also permitted Mahanta to continue with the engagement on behalf of MUDA unless he himself decides to withdraw.
The Court further said that petition has been filed by tenants who are occupants of buildings said to be in violation of MUDA byelaws. However, the buildings, like other similar structures have been sealed by MUDA under the direction of the Court.
The petitioners prayed for issuance of order directing the respondents – Secretary, MUDA, Deputy Commissioner, East Khasi Hills District and Superintendent of Police, to open the sealed premises and hand over the possessions there of to them.
“As the case is in the midst of hearing; as prima facie the construction is in violation of MUDA guidelines, and as the said premises have been sealed, we are not inclined to grant any interim relief for the present. Let this matter be clubbed with other matters relating to high rise buildings of Shillong,” the Court said.

He further informed that that the trial of the case will be held at the Court of Special Judge, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.
The Customs official also informed that the Special NDPS Judge Belma Mawrie remanded him in two-day custody on Friday.

ARPA chairman Metbah Lyngdoh urged the KHADC EC to bring an official resolution in the House during the ongoing session to give a strong message that the Council wants amendments which will protect the overall the interest of the local indigenous people of the State.
Echoing similar views, former KHADC CEM Adelbert Nongrum asked the EC to come out with an official resolution with urgency since the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has come up with the final draft of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2013.   He also claimed that the Union Ministry has not incorporated even a single suggestion submitted by the KHADC earlier.
Referring to Paragraph 2 of sub-paragraph 1 in the final draft, Nongrum said this paragraph states that the KHADC shall consist of not more than forty members of whom five members including at least two women members shall be nominated by the Governor and the rest shall be elected on the basis of adult suffrage.
“I see no justification in increasing the number of seats since attempts are being made to weaken the Council as an institution,” Nongrum said.
Referring to Paragraph 2A (1) of the final draft, he said the paragraph states that within a period of one year from the date of commencement of the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty Third Amendment) Act, 2015, each District Council shall establish village councils for a village or group of villagers in the rural areas and municipal councils for an urban area or an agglomeration of such urban areas of the district.

The Judge in the order also said that ‘bail bonds for the accused person furnished and accepted” and fixed the next date of hearing on July 8.
However, later the public prosecutor along with City  SP Vivek Syiem appeared  before the court and submitted a letter that the accused has not been interrogated and his statement under section 161 CrPC was not taken .

However, police maintained that since Islam was absconding, the police wanted him in custody for interrogation.                 Since  the accused needs to be interrogated thoroughly and also there is a need to  verify the authenticity of the bailors, the Judge fixed July 8 as the next date of hearing for producing  the accused and filling report on the verification of bailors."

TURA: Campaigning for the June 27 by-elections to Chokpot assembly constituency in South Garo Hills ended on a peaceful note on Friday with political parties and candidates making last minute appeals to woo voters.
The three main political parties, Garo National Council, Congress and NPP held a series of public meetings on the last day of campaigning.
Kalpana Sangma of GNC is banking on the sympathy wave to garner the maximum support. Members of the Garo Hills State Movement Committee (GHSMC) actively campaigned for the widow of Clifford R Marak, whose death necessitated the by-poll.
The two rival political parties, Congress and NPP were  also out in force to make their presence felt before campaigning winded up.
Congress leaders fanned out to various corners of Chokpot to seek votes with senior leaders campaigning at Mebonpara and Agalgre areas.
On the other hand, the NPP rolled out the red carpet for its top leader on the last day of campaigning. Former Lok Sabha Speaker and party president Purno Agitok Sangma was in Chokpot main town to close the campaign finale of his party.
Both parties took to verbal slugfest to woo voters with each claiming to better the other.
Congress leaders, including D D Lapang, has vouched for former NCP leader Masonsing Sangma’s wife and current Congress candidate Bluebell  Sangma as the best bet for the party in the by-poll.
“We are looking at winnability of the candidate,” Lapang had earlier said.
Congress working president Deborah C Marak had campaigned for Bluebell a few days ago and was backed by other Congress leaders including Lapang.

1055,EC rejects Opp demand for special inquiry,"Friday, June 26, 2015","Misleading info provided to Dorbar Ri Ka Bri Hynniewtrep
SHILLONG: Opposition MDCs in the KHADC on Thursday demanded constitution of a special inquiry to find out the person(s) responsible for providing misleading information regarding passage of the KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2015 which was announced during the meeting of the Dorbar Ri Ka Bri Hynniewtrep on May 30, despite the fact that the matter was still being discussed in the House during the special session on that day.
Moving a motion on the issue, KHNAM MDC James Ban Basaiawmoit expressed shock that there was an announcement during the May 30 meeting at around 2:15 pm that all the 30 KHADC MDCs had unanimously passed the Bill.
The discussion on the bill during the special session lasted till 3:30 pm, Basaiawmoit reminded, while adding that thousands of people had been fed wrong information about the unanimous passage of the bill despite the fact that only 16 MDCs had supported the passage of the modified VAB while the ARPA was never in favour of the Bill.
Echoing similar views, former      KHADC CEM Adelbert Nongrum said it was a breach of privilege on the conduct of business of the House.
He observed that the concerned person who provided the misleading information might be having some hidden agenda.
HSPDP MDC Pyniaid Sing Syiem suggested that there should be clear direction that all the MDCs and staff of the Council including the media and the general public who comes to attend the Council session should switch off their mobile phones to prevent people from disseminating wrong information about the proceedings of the House.
Leader of Opposition Metbah Lyngdoh demanded that the special committee should comprise members from both side of the House.
“This is a huge insult to the prestige of this House. We have to investigate to ensure that such things are not repeated,” he said.
Executive Member in charge Elaka, Lamphrang Blah, however, turned down the demand for constitution of a special inquiry.
“This matter had come to a close after the House had passed the bill during the special session,” Blah said.
Despite the refusal, the opposition MDCs continued to demand for constitution of an inquiry.
Later, Deputy Chairman Gabriel Wahlang, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House for the day the advice of KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem."

1064,"Jetragre: A village of unfulfilled promises, but smacks a political punch","Friday, June 26, 2015","TURA: A pristine village nestled on the foothills of the mighty Durama Hills under Chokpot assembly constituency-Jetragre village feels like a place from the past.
There is no electricity or telecommunication network, drinking water facilities or even a basic health sub-centre, and the only road to reach this mountainous village, dotted with raging waterfalls surrounded by lush green forests, is a backbreaking journey through an abandoned coal mining road cut from the hill sides by earthmovers to transport the black gold which once brought some semblance of material wealth to the surrounding villages.
That dream has now disappeared with the NGT ban currently in force throughout the state to prevent further destruction of the environment caused by unscientific mining.
But what Jetragre lacks in the developmental front, it makes up for in its political unity. It holds a single polling station that cover six villages accounting for over more than 500 voters.
“We are all united and want to see the development of our village. We have made it known to all the contesting candidates that development precedes everything else,” says Bijendro Sangma.
Hailing from Rongasigre village under Jetra polling station, 80-year-old Bijendro’s word holds weight in his area by virtue of him being the Laskar of Chokpot Elaka.
“I have long cherished the dream to see a good motor able road and electricity flow into my home and my village. I hope it will be a reality in my time. We will vote for the candidate who can best deliver on his or her promise,” says Laskar Bijendro as polling day nears.
For the villagers of Jetragre, Darenggre, Rongasigre, Rongro A’simgre, Kakijagre and Songsamgre daily life begins with the break of dawn and ends as darkness falls since absence of power seriously hampers evening life.
Rural electrification of their villages under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana has not been completed and villagers complain over the delay as posts and wires are seen dumped on the sides of the dirk track which also acts as the only ‘viable’ road to connect main town Chokpot, approximately 15 kms away down south.
Coal mining in the hills of Chokpot-particularly the Jetragre-Budugre area has been intense in the run up to the NGT ban. Several dozen rat hole mines came up as prospective miners and firms began heading up north of Chokpot towards Jetragre to make it rich. In the process the men of the villages benefitted monetarily but at the cost of the environment as intense damage took place from haphazard cutting of hills and felling of trees.
“We use to earn between Rs.3000-6000 in a week from extracting coal from beneath the hill and stocking it up for the trucks to carry them. With the ban our earnings have dried up and we are now dependent on jhum cultivation and menial labour which itself is hard to find in the villages,” says ex-miner Willip Sangma (45) who has six children to look out for.
His eldest son dropped out of this year’s IInd year BA from a college in Tura since the father could not provide him for his education. “I could not afford for his education this year. I am hoping things will be better, next year,” adds Willip.
The people living in these villages have now gone into betel leaf growing to tide over their financial difficulties. Entire families and villages have joined the betel leaf plantations and the crop can be seen growing on trees all along the area.
“We use to earlier supply the produce to Chokpot but now we are able to export it to Tura and even Garobadha market from where wholesale agents from Assam purchase them in bulk,” says a beaming Willip Sangma confident good days are once again in the offing.
Transportation will continue to remain a bottleneck for the inhabitants of this area since a long term road project connecting Chokpot to Williamnagar town in East Garo Hills via Jetra having not taken off for more than 30 long years.
“In 1978 the PWD road survey took place via our village but nothing has moved after that,” says Gremson M Sangma (47) of Rongru Asimgre.
During the monsoons it is near impossible for even the four wheeled coal trucks to utilise the mining road and the sick and elderly have to be carried on foot to Chokpot for medical treatment.
“To sell our goods and purchase household items from the Weekly Chokpot market we have to leave the village by 2 O’clock in the morning to reach on time. Elderly women who go down on Tuesday for the market can return only by next day because of the difficult journey,” says Gremson Sangma.
He along with the rest of his people is hoping good days will come like the success betel leaf cultivation post Chokpot by-election."
1065,EM cornered over multiple trading license issue,"Friday, June 26, 2015","SHILLONG: The Opposition MDCs in the KHADC cornered Executive Member in charge Trade, James Sylliang after he failed to give a convincing reply on whether any private firm which operates multiple industrial units would be required to obtain separate trading licenses for each of the units from the Council.
The Opposition was unhappy when Sylliang gave an unconvincing reply to a supplementary posed by Opposition leader Metbah Lyngdoh who wanted to know whether firms run by non-tribals were permitted to operate multiple businesses with a single trading license issued by the KHADC.
“The firm is free to operate more than one of its business units with one trading license,” Sylliang replied.
The argument had cropped up after the EM in charge of Trade stated that the Council had closed one of the units of the Meghalaya Agrovet Private Limited (MAPL) at Mawthei in Ri Bhoi following complaints from the village dorbar and the residents of the area.
Not satisfied with the reply, the Opposition leader asked whether the unit had been closed due to the failure of the firm to obtain a separate license for its unit at Mawthei.
After much deliberation, the EM after receiving a slip from the KHADC officers accepted that the MAPL unit was closed since it had failed to obtain trading license from the Council.
It may be mentioned that the MAPL had obtain a trading license only for its unit at Tdoh Umsaw and had opened a second unit at Mawshei without obtaining a second license from the KHADC."

Pointing out even if there is a non-confidence motion against her, the KHADC chief said that she was ready to face it since she would like to know on what ground they wanted to remove her."

“I don’t want to divulge more details as the matter is sub-judice, ” Nawas told reporters on Wednesday.
He also revealed that while police and the Government had all along been  claiming that his father has been absconding ,”the fact is that he has been regularly  coming to the High Court of Meghalaya and the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate twice in connection with the case”.

Interestingly, the Home department had earlier claimed that several look out notices were issued by Meghalaya police against Islam and  police teams had even gone to Assam  to find him but he could not be arrested.

“We were students, how can we shield our father and the allegations of the police officer were not true”, Nawaz said. He said that his MBBS certificate was withheld by the college authorities for several months and it was released only after the intervention from the Court.
According to Nawaz, his father had good track record of as many as 28 years in police and the rape charge in the police station at night and later at the residence of one of the victims surfaced due to the handiwork of some vested interests. He said the whole family including his mother and sister is devastated due to the allegations against his father.

1075,From Our Special Correspondent,"Thursday, June 25, 2015","SHILLONG: It was an extremely close shave for PDF nominee Gabriel Wahlang when he was elected to the post of Deputy Chairman of the KHADC on Wednesday without having to face the election.
Had voting actually taken place, Wahlang might have been actually defeated by a single vote as was evident during a ‘trial voting’ conducted by the PDF MDCs inside the chamber of KHADC CEM Pynshngain Syiem before the start of the proceedings on Wednesday.
During the ‘trial voting’ votes cast by three MDCs of the ruling coalition were found to be invalid since they had mentioned the wrong dates in the ballot paper.
Sources revealed that on two MDCs had wrongly mentioned the date as 25 instead of 24 while in another case the concerned MDC had wrongly mentioned the year as 2014 instead of 2015.
In the House of 30, the PDF has the support of 16 MDCs while the opposition alliance, ARPA, enjoys the support of 13 MDCs minus the KHADC Chairperson Teilinia Thangkhiew.
In the event of actual voting and with three invalid votes, there would have been a tie between the PDF candidate Wahlang and ARPA nominee Rona Khymdeit with 13 votes each.
In the case of a tie, the chairperson, who is from the ARPA camp, would have been allowed to vote in favour of Khymdeit which would have helped her to secure the post of the deputy chairman by a single vote.
Interestingly, Mawkyrwat MDC Hadrian Lyngdoh, while congratulating Wahlang on his election as the deputy chairman unopposed, disclosed that he was feeling ‘nervous’ while anticipating that voting will take place.
“I was relieved only after hearing that ARPA nominee Rona Khymdeit has withdrawn from the race,” Lyngdoh said, while mentioning that three ballot papers had been found to be invalid during the ‘trial voting’ held in the CEM’s chamber earlier in the day.
The Mawkyrwat MDC, however, did not reveal the names of the three MDCs whose votes were found to be invalid."
1076,NEIGRIHMS ‘autonomy’ issue to come up during governing council meet,"Thursday, June 25, 2015","New Delhi: The long pending issue of autonomy to the North Eastern Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Sciences (NEIGRIHMS) would be raised in its first governing council meeting under the Chairmanship of J.P. Nadda to be held at Shillong on Friday.
Lone Rajya Sabha member from Meghalaya, Wansuk Syiem, who is a member of the Governing Council, is already in Shillong to attend the meeting.
There was a proposal to grant autonomous status to the super-specialty referral hospital with state-of-the-art-technology in the line of the AIIMS and six such other bodies coming up in other parts of the country.
But growth and expansion of NEIGRIHMS has been consistently stymied by the ad hocism on the part of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for long.
In 2012 during the governing council meeting, the then Union Health Minister had     endorsed the need for granting autonomy to the Institute which is yet to be implemented.
Incidentally, six AIIMS like institutions which started elsewhere in India, much later than NEIGRIHMS, were granted autonomous character through an Act of Parliament from their very inception.
But NEIGRIHMS is still struggling since it falls under the MCI regulations in the absence of autonomous status.
This is despite the fact that the NDA Government is embarking on an ambitious expansion network of the country’s premier health care institutions."

1078,Assam govt forces Khasis to enroll under NRC: KSU,"Thursday, June 25, 2015","Union against implementation of Aadhaar Card scheme in Ri Bhoi
NONGPOH: There seems to be no end to the blatant violation of the status quo agreement signed between the Meghalaya and the Assam government, by the latter, with the latest case being its forced infringement in the disputed Block II area where the Assam government has been compelling the Khasi residents to enroll themselves in the National Register of Citizens (NRC).
The matter came to light during a meeting between a delegation of the KSU North Khasi Hills District Unit and Ri Bhoi Deputy Commissioner Pooja Pandey on Tuesday evening.
The KSU leaders expressed grave concern over the fact that the Assam government had set up an NRC office at Ummat in Block II area in Ri Bhoi District to enroll the local residents.
Speaking to the newsmen here on Wednesday evening, KSU (NKHD) chief F.K. Kharkamni said the Union, during their meeting with the deputy commissioner, demanded a magisterial enquiry into the forced enrolment of Khasi villagers in the Assam NRC.
The KSU unit further expressed displeasure at the implementation of National Population Register (Aadhaar Card scheme) in Ri Bhoi District at a time when the Dorbar Shnong and the Rangbah Shnong were functioning without powers to accord recognition to genuine residents of their respective villages in the district.
The KSU unit chief asserted that the Aadhaar card was not mandatory as per the Supreme Court ruling in 2013.
Kharkamni also informed that the deputy commissioner assured that she would conduct an inquiry into the allegation of forced enrolment under NRC by the Assam government and would also hold consultations with all concerned stakeholders before moving ahead with NRC implementation in Ri Bhoi District."

John in an e-mail has replied to some queries posed to him by The Shillong Times with regard to the controversy at the college. Excerpts from the interview:"
1081,Bad results: Lecturers blame Principal,"Thursday, June 25, 2015","TURA: The lecturers of Don Bosco College, Tura have claimed that the reputation of a college rests on the hard work and sacrifice of the teaching faculty over a period of two decades and not merely over the appointment of a Principal.
The lecturers were reacting to the news item which appeared in this paper where they were allegedly accused by college Principal, Fr. P.D. John of bringing down the performance of the college.
The lecturers claimed that Don Bosco College and B.Ed. College were producing good results even before the incumbent Principal came into the picture and asked if the outcome of the poor results in the last two years was not because of his lack of qualification as per the UGC norms.
“It is rather amusing to note that Fr. John had given a graphic dissection of the result of Don Bosco College of one year. Is it not a self dissection and laying bare of oneself for everyone to study him?” they questioned.
They said that the general objective of Don Bosco College was not how many positions it can secure each year but how many students it can help to succeed which concerns mostly the rural youths.
“The teachers had been adamant that they also include and help rural youths who have not secured very good marks in the class x examinations, but Fr. John was intent on displaying the elitist approach,” the lecturers claimed.
They accused the Principal of cancelling courses and subjects, some of which were offered nowhere else in Garo Hills and added that cutting down courses and subjects would do no good as all cannot be restricted to limited subject options.
The teachers maintained that if the results were poor, it was probably because some of the good practices were done away with by the Principal himself.
“Regular interval exams are not held anymore. Fortnightly attendance monitoring of students and mentoring of students have been done away with. Committees for academic and co-curricular activities have been rendered defunct and students’ diary which records performance details is no more printed. Teaching aids of teachers, such as departmental laptops, printers etc., have been confiscated and sold,” they alleged.
The teachers also alleged that not one Academic Council meeting had been called in the past one and a half years.
They claimed the teachers were completely cut off from all activities that they were earlier involved in.
“He does not involve the teachers in the admission process of students. But when the results are bad, he blames the teachers,” they remarked."

1085,Labour license: KHADC warns contractors,"Wednesday, June 24, 2015","SHILLONG: The Khasi Hills Autonomous District Council (KHADC) has warned of stern action against contractors who fail to register and obtain labour license for their migrant labourers working in different parts of the state.
“We are committed to take action against the contractors who fail to register the migrant workers with the Council,” Executive Member in-charge Labour department Banteidor Lyngdoh said while replying to a question raised by UDP MDC Rona Khymdeit on the first day of the budget session here on Tuesday.
“The executive committee and the labour department have been conducting checking drives of labour license for the last 13 days,” Lyngdoh said adding “We are planning to conduct the checking in all the four districts under the Council.”
His assurance came after the  opposition members sought clarification as to why the number of labour license issued by the council are less when compared to the numbers of migrant labourers working in its jurisdiction.
Informing that a total of 1079 labour license have been issued till date, the EM said, “Of this, a total of 818 was issued in East Khasi Hills District, 171 in Ri Bhoi District, 71 in West Khasi Hills District and only 19 in South West Khasi Hills District,” adding “The revenue collected from this is Rs 2.15 lakh.” UDP MDC Brolding Nongsiej said that it was surprising to see that the council had issued only 171 labour licenses in Ri Bhoi, a district having many factories and industries operating within its jurisdiction.
According to him, there are quite a large number of migrant labourers from Assam and most of them do not have licenses.
Earlier while replying to a supplementary posed by UDP MDC R Khymdeit on the criteria for issuing the labour license, the EM said, “Production of EPIC card is mandatory beside other relevant documents which include police verification.”
Meanwhile, the Chief Executive Member (CEM) PN Syiem however said since the district council does not have a labour act, it is decided that from now on any cases of failure to obtain labour license, the labour department is directed to also refer the matter to trade department for necessary action to the extent of cancellation of the trading license."

Presenting the budget on first day of the KHADC Summer Session, Syiem informed that the total expenditure estimated is Rs.92,56,99,990 which is more than the expected revenue to be received by the Council in the fiscal.
He said that as per the estimates, the revenue for the Council will be Rs.92,56,54,170, which will lead to a deficit of Rs.45,820.
He appealed to the various departments to minimise their expenditure so as to improve the financial position of the Council.
Syiem said that a major chunk of the Council’s revenue is used up in payment of salaries to the staff.
The KHADC CEM informed that the major share of the revenue of the Council comes through issuing of trading license, royalty from minerals, share from motor vehicle taxes, taxes on professionals and other sources.
He further informed that the KHADC Executive Committee has decided to put pressure on the State government to enhance the Council’s shares from major and minor minerals besides taxes earned from motor vehicles.
“We will also take up the matter with the State Government for early release of the shares,” he said.
According to him, the revenue generated by the Council in 2014-2015 was very less since the State government had deducted money from the Council’s shares to cover the expenditure incurred in the last KHADC election.

“I will step down only if questions are raised about my incompetency and inefficiency to conduct the proceedings of the House,” Thangkhiew told newsmen here on Tuesday, while asserting that none of the MDCs has questioned her inefficiency and incompetency.
Asked about the possibility of the PDF bringing a no confidence motion against her, the KHADC chairperson put up a brave face said that she was ready to face the no-confidence motion inside the House since she was interested in knowing the basis on which they were planning to remove her.  “It will be an embarrassment for the ruling coalition if they attempt to remove me on whimsical grounds,” she added.
Citing the case of the West Bengal Assembly, Thangkhiew said the post of the Speaker is being occupied by a CPI(M) legislator despite Trinamool Congress (TMC) being in power.
“Therefore, my continuation as the KHADC chairperson should not be a problem,” she said.
The KHADC chairpersons, however, admitted that her continuation in the office will depend on the ‘number game’.

The Tengsak Momin-led faction of the GSU along with three other organizations AYWO, FKJGP and ADE have jointly called for the appointment of a new Principal to end the stalemate which is hampering the normal functioning of classes in the degree level of the college.
These pressure groups point to the sudden transfer of the previous Principal to make way for the current head, Fr. P.D. John, which was opposed by many and led to questions about the decision within the ranks.
The four organizations also claim that under UGC norms only one with a Ph.D can hold the Principal’s position and have questioned the current head’s position in this regard.
On the Don Bosco B.Ed College front, these organizations have blamed Fr. P. D. John for raising the fees to the tune of Rs 60,000/- per year after he assumed charge.
“If the college does not benefit the local people then the faith, hopes and aspiration of many students of Garo Hills is dashed to the ground and the benevolence of the people which has made the college possible by giving land for the institution is simply a betrayal of their good faith and understanding. As far as we can calculate, students from outside the state outnumber the local students in the B Ed College, Tura. This does not bode well for the aspiring students of Garo Hills. Of what use is a college where locals are denied the opportunity?” the four organizations questioned in a release to the media and alleged that the governing body of the college was not invited for meetings to discuss various matters.
A number of accusations have also been levelled by the organizations such as a charge of Rs 50/- for certificates like experience certificates, NOCs and Committee Certificates even from Lecturers, charge of  Rs 300/- for handbooks by students in last two years which they claim its copy remains unavailable, disconnection of internet although charge of Rs. 1400/- as establishment charge is taken.
They also claim other financial payments like Rs. 5/- for seal on certificates of authentication, charge of Rs 100/- for student identity cards annually, Rs 200/- and Rs 300/- for the issuance of Transfer Certificate categorise as ‘Normal’ and ‘Emergency’ and a fine of Rs 1000/- on students not turning up on opening day of the college. The four organizations also claimed that there have been instances of the salaries of lecturers being held up on flimsy grounds and allege that one former lecturer had his service terminated through a mobile sms despite serving ten months in the college.The decision to do away with the college bus service on grounds it had become obsolete has also been raised by the organizations which are demanding to know where the money from the sale of the buses  has been put into."

The MUDA, without considering the security aspect, had several years ago granted permission to Ferndale apartments, posing security threat to the Main Secretariat.
Another building is the upcoming five-star hotel at Jail road at the site of old Shillong Municipal Board.
There have been issues raised about the multi-storied building just adjacent to the Shillong Jail. Having the multi-storied building, which would be a hotel, adjacent to the jail poses serious security threat. The top floor would have a clear view of the jail beneath as it is of considerable height and goes against the maximum height of 17 meters prescribed by the recent Cabinet meeting."
1102,MUDA to fix security zones,"Tuesday, June 23, 2015","Violation of building laws
SHILLONG: The Meghalaya Urban Development Authority (MUDA) will soon undertake an exercise to identify security zones and others for buildings within Shillong city in an attempt to impose further restriction on height and usages of the buildings.
“We will soon undertake the exercise to identify various zones in various parts of the city. Once the zones are identified, we can impose further restrictions on height and usages of buildings in different areas of the city as prescribed under the Meghalaya Town and Country Planning Act,” a senior official said here on Monday.
According to the official, security will be one of the prominent features while identifying the zones for construction of buildings.
“The security aspect will be taken into account while giving permissions for construction of buildings in different zones,” a senior official said.
While citing an example, he said that there will be certain restrictions in terms of the height of the buildings in places near Raj Bhavan area due to security concerns.
MUDA would also take into consideration the zoning norms as prescribed under the Meghalaya Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act, 2004.
Although the Cabinet has proposed amendments to the Meghalaya Building bylaws, there are still works that need to be done.
MUDA has been in the docks after a PIL was filed at the Meghalaya High Court on high-rise buildings in a highly seismic zone like Meghalaya.
A committee formed on the orders of the High Court then sealed 24 buildings here for violating building bylaws. So the Government has tried to bring in amendments to the bylaws saying more clarity is required on several aspects of the law.
Meanwhile, some see the decision to consider amendment to the bylaws as an attempt to legitimize acts of violations. The Civil Society of Women’s Organisation (CSWO,) dashed of a letter to the Chief Justice of the Meghalaya High Court, the law and urban affairs department opposing any amendment.
“Surprised that the State Government is rushing in to legalise such violations, by amending laws to accommodate violators,” CSWO president, Agnes Kharshiing said in the letter."

During its two-day visit to the State on June 17 and 18, the team also visited several coal mines in Jaintia Hills.
An official said on Monday  that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the need to set out  a guideline for coal mining following the interim ban by NGT on rat hole mining in the State.
After the NGT ordered ban of rat hole mining, the State Government had sought the intervention of the Centre to help the state to adopt effective measures before resuming coal trade.
Following the request from the State Government, the Centre had deputed the team of officials from   Central Mine Planning and Design Institute, Coal India Limited and Director General of Mine Safety to visit the state aimed at preparing guidelines to enable the State Government to carry out mining after undertaking various safety measures.
“These officials are also part of the group of experts  who had met in Delhi twice in the past to discuss the  ways and means to adopt a viable guideline for mining of coal in the State”, the official said.
The assistance of the Central establishment was sought since the State Government does not have expertise for carrying out coal mining with safeguards. Moreover, mining of coal is a central subject, the official added.
NGT wanted proper mining plan put in place before it reviews the decision on the ban on coal mining during the next hearing scheduled for next month in Delhi.
The NGT had already given time till June 30 for the transportation of already extracted coal in the state.

“The PWD’s South Division Office has not paid its muster-roll employees their salary since December last,” RTI activist Desparsing Rani told reporters here on Monday.
“If the PHE department has no problem in disbursing salary to its workers every month, then why is the PWD restraining itself from doing the same,” Rani, who sought information through RTI, questioned.
According to him, several government departments have failed to pay their muster roll staff as per the revised rate, which came into force on June 11, 2014.
“The trade unions (All India Trade Union Congress or International Workers’ Trade Union Congress) were never informed about the new revised rates,” the RTI activist said.

However, an official source said on Monday that there was no need to wait for the reply of Accountant General as the departmental inquiry is independent and the health department can act on its own and take action against those who were responsible for the wastage of medicines.
A senior health official who was part of the recent meeting to review the mode of purchase of medicines in the wake of the controversy over expired medicines said that the department will develop software to enable the medial institutions in the state to send the requirements digitally so that the medicines can be supplied as per the needs.
“We will also ensure that the quantity of medicines to be purchased is as per the requirements”, the official added.

The misery of the affected families did not end there as the village dorbar allegedly also denied them the benefits of government schemes especially the centrally sponsored ones like MGNREGS.
A group of journalists who visited the village on Saturday found that out of the 22 families, four have again started availing the PDS after the village dorbar revoked its decision recently.

We are not sure if the case he was referring to is the assistance we had taken from the CSWO when we were initially denied the PDS rice,” Byrjai Majaw who belongs to the one of the eight families who are being denied the PDS since 2013 told newsmen.

On the other hand, the governor is examining the similar bill passed by the Jaintia Hills Autonomous District Council (JHADC), forwarded to him by the state government recently.

1144,From bandh to ‘democratic’ agitations,"Sunday, June 21, 2015","SHILLONG: Bandhs seem to have made way for more democratic ways of agitation in the State after the Meghalaya High Court directive against bandh culture.
It was on May 27 that the High Court of Meghalaya came down heavily against the bandh culture prevailing in the state after the city came to a stand sill during the bandh called by HNLC.   After the order of the High Court, the Hynniewtrep Youth Council (HYC), which was fighting for the original Village Administration Bill had said that it would resort to democratic means of agitation. Later, the conglomeration of headmen called a rally at Polo which was another democratic way of apprising the Government on the need to empower the traditional heads.
It is no secret that the State has been witness to bandhs forced by pressure groups and NGOs in the past whenever their demands were not met. But post the High Court ruling, the trend may see a change in the months to come.
In Garo Hills, after president of the All A’chik Youth Federation Salsam Marak had called a two-day all Garo Hills closure on May 19-20 to protest the delay on the part of the Government in holding polls to GHADC, police arrested Marak and placed him under the Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO). The state government was compelled to act against bandh perpetrators following a directive from the High Court of Meghalaya. In this context, the All A’chik Youth Federation has already announced that it will resort to democratic means of protest for the release of the arrested leader.
Few years back, the State Cabinet had passed the Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO) to act against the bandh culture in Meghalaya but the act failed to make any impact and the bandh culture continued in the state. But the trend seems to heading for a change now."

1150,Sacred Groves being destroyed: Villagers,"Saturday, June 20, 2015","SHILLONG: The State Government might be going gung ho over the upcoming Terra Madre International Slow Food Festival at Mawphlang in November, but residents of the village, home to the famed Sacred Groves, have alleged that unwarranted activities arising out of the preparations for the slow food festival have been slowly but surely destroying the Law Kyntang (Sacred Groves).
The residents also took exception to unwanted activities in the Sacred Groves in the name of development.
“Each and every tourist who visits the Sacred Groves has admired the natural beauty of the Law Kyntang. But we now fear that the sacred forest which was given to us by our forefathers will be totally destroyed to serve the selfish interests of a few people,” residents of the village stated.
The villagers pointed out to ongoing construction work inside the Law Kyntang which has been initiated as preparation for the upcoming festival.
As per official documents available with the villagers, the State Government has sanctioned Rs.19 crore for a road which will come up in the Law Kyntang along with improvement of the various internal roads in Mawphlang.
“We may recall that no one has ever dared to carry a twig home from this place. Now the greed of some people has destroyed it. Women from the village who went to pray in the sacred forest have claimed that the upcoming festival is not a ‘food fest’ but a ‘corruption fest’,” the villagers stated.
Lyngdoh of Hima Mawphlang, N.K. Lyngdoh, however denied any destruction to the Sacred Groves.
“The Government had sanctioned Rs.22 crore for improvement of the road from Lad Mawreng up to Mawphlang as part of the pre-developmental project for the festival,” he said.
Besides improvement of the internal road within Mawphlang village, the sanctioned amount also includes construction of a road behind Law Kyntang, he stated.
“We are constructing the road to allow people who come to the festival to visit places of historical importance like Maw Shyieng and Khmah Lyngdoh (the places where the Hima performs the traditional prayers) which is located behind the Sacred Groves,” the Lyngdoh said.
He however denied that there is an attempt to destroy the natural beauty of the sacred groves.
When asked about the boulders lying inside the Sacred Groves, he said the boulders have emerged as a result of the earthwork taken up by the PWD for road construction.
“We have tried our best to ensure minimal destruction. The department had taken up the work as per the measurement given by the elders of the Hima following a joint inspection,” he said.
He also said that the department is expected to complete the construction of the road by the end of September."
1151,Mob lynches 2 ‘extortionists’ in Garo Hills,"Saturday, June 20, 2015","TURA: A mob of several dozen people gave chase to a group of alleged extortionists and lynched two of the suspects at Rongjeng  town in East Garo Hills district shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The deceased, according to police, have been identified as Lakingbat Marak and Senstar Marak and the duo hailed from Gaomari village,   near Rongjeng, although unconfirmed report indicated that one of the deceased belonged to Nongshram village. A demand for extortion money was reportedly made to a villager by a five-member gang of extortionists who claimed to be from the AMEF outfit.
Since the gang had demanded that the victim bring the extortion money to a designated spot on Thursday night an alert was sounded by the locals who decided to keep vigil in groups at different localities of the town to intercept the criminals. Shortly after midnight the public gave chase to a group of suspects who were waiting at a selected spot in Rongjeng Songma.
The mob caught up with two persons and gave them a severe beating before lynching them.
The accused were identified as members of the gang after it was allegedly found that the extortion demand and threats had been made from a phone number that was in possession with one of the suspects.
It was also reported that both the deceased had previously spent time in prison for being members of a militant group involved in criminal activities.
“Police was alerted about the lynching by some people and when our teams rushed to the spot they found the bodies of two persons. By that time the mob had also disappeared. We have registered a case,” informed district police chief Davis Nestell R Marak.
Rampant extortion and public lynching wherein people have taken the law into one’s own hands frustrated by the slow pace of arrests and breakthroughs by the law enforcement agencies has plagued Garo Hills since the last two years.
Last July, in Jambal village, near Rongjeng, three members of a extortion gang were beaten to death by the public while another two criminals were lynched at Silchang gittim, on the same day. The public chased the two gangs after they tried to extort money from villagers and opened fire in the air to frighten the angry mob.
The pent up anger against criminals could be gauged from the rise in public lynching in various places in Garo Hills with several cases getting reported almost every week, till some time ago.
In May, 2014, three extortionists were lynched at Adokgre area of North Garo Hills while another two were killed in South Garo Hills district. Many other cases have gone unreported, it is learnt."

Five suspected AMEF militants lobbed two IED bombs inside the Virgo cement plant at Damas under Mendipathar PS in North Garo Hills at around 2:10 in the morning.
The first bomb exploded next to the sentry post partially damaging it.
A second bomb was lobbed towards the compound housing the cement processing machines but it exploded in an open space and did not cause any damage.
Following the two explosions the militants also opened fire and fled into the darkness.
Police recovered two empty shells of AK ammunition from the spot where the militants launched their attack.
Extortion demand on the cement company by the outfit has not been ruled out.
Damas is a sensitive area bordering Assam and several outfits and criminal gangs operate in the area taking advantage of the inter-state border.
Outfits like GNLA, ULFA and NDFB operate in the area. A group called the Rabha Vipers Army was active in the area for quite some time, two years ago, kidnapping several people including railway officials engaged in the Dudhnoi-Mendipathar broad gauge railway line which got inaugurated last year."

The cadres belonged to one of its camps located at Emangre village in South Garo Hills.
The surrendered cadres are Enok Ch Marak alias Bisil (18) of Jonangpara village in West Garo Hills, Baiti M Sangma alias Namreng (23) of Aruakgre village in South Garo Hills, Lorence M Sangma alias Kulam (18) of Mandalgre village in East Garo Hills and   Clifford Marak alias Jakjip (18) of Rongchekgre village in East Garo Hills.
“I was motivated by area commander Hedio in 2012. He told me that we would fight for Garoland. However, I was asked to do odd jobs like cooking and washing clothes for senior cadres. I couldn’t take it anymore and decided to quit GNLA,” said Enok, who had joined the outfit at the age of 15.
He had undergone trainings and had recently met his ‘commander-in-chief’ Sohan D Shira.
Enok and the other three, who surrendered on Thursday, have not completed their training. They said that due to police operation they had to move around and could not complete their training.
The cadres denied their involvement in criminal activities. “I was never used for any kidnapping or extortion,” said Baiti Sangma, who joined the outfit in May last year.
West Garo Hills Addl. SP Bruno A Sangma informed that the cadres got in touch with a Reverend before surrendering to Tura Police.
“The cadres walked on foot from Emangre village to Silkigre village and reached Tura via bus today. Their statements will be recorded before they are sent to three months’ rehabilitation at Goeragre Battalion Camp,” he said.
There were no arms deposited during the surrender as the cadres were used as helpers by the senior cadres. All four of them had reportedly worked under area commanders Hedio and Baichung.
“They were trained by senior ULFA cadres and GNLA top brass. However, they could not complete their training due to continuous insurgency operation across Garo Hills,” the Addl. SP informed.
At Emangre camp the four surrendered rebels were reportedly in the company of 16 ULFA cadres."

“It is the prerogative of the State Government to incorporate our views on the proposed amendment. I am greatly concerned about this adamant attitude of the Government in not briefing us on the matter,” he said.
He informed that in a meeting attended by all the 30 MDCs of the Council, it was resolved that a reminder would be sent to the State government seeking the status of the proposal sent to the government.
One of the suggestions made by the KHADC was the demand for ‘exemption’ of Para 3 of Paragraph 12 (a) of the Sixth Schedule which talks about issues related to ‘Land’ and ‘Customs’.
“In the first draft amendment to the Sixth Schedule, it was indirectly proposed to exempt Para 3 of Paragraph 12 (a) but now it is learnt that in the proposed final draft, this proposal has been withdrawn,” the CEM said.
According to him, the Council, however, felt that there is a need to exempt this clause to ensure that issues related to land and customs are exclusive subjects of the Council.
“At present, this clause is the main hindrance to the  Council in case it wants to come up with legislation since the state law will always prevail over it,” Syiem said.
Besides the earlier proposals, the meeting also decided to submit additional views and suggestions on the final draft amendment.
“As a preparation to this, all the 30 MDCs have been urged to submit their views and suggestions to my office (CEM) before June 25,” he said."

1181,"ATM theft mastermind arrested, released on bail","Friday, June 19, 2015","JOWAI: The alleged mastermind behind the recent ATM thefts in the State was arrested on Wednesday only to be granted bail by the court of the CJM later on grounds that the cops did not follow the procedure under Section 41 CrPC while apprehending the accused.
The accused, Hassen Ali hailing from Kamrup District of Assam is allegedly involved in a number of ATM theft cases in the state. Ali was apprehended Dkhiah West in East Jaintia Hills after police raided his residence following a tip-off.
Ali was wanted by East Jaintia Hills and West Jaintia Hills police for allegedly lifting an SBI ATM with cash of over Rs. 9 lakh, a SBI ATM in Jowai with cash of Rs. 9.11 lakh and another SBI ATM in Madanriting containing cash of Rs. 14.96 lakh in February last. He was also wanted by Ri Bhoi Police for stealing ATMs containing cash of Rs.26 lakh from Nongbah in September 2014.
The accused was brought to Jowai and produced at a court here. While police requested the court to remand the accused to 5-day police custody so that he can be thoroughly interrogated, the court of the CJM denied police custody and released the accused on PR Bond.
The CJM granted him bail under section 41CrPC which states that any person accused under any sections of IPC with a punishment of less than seven years should first be served with a notice.
“According to the CJM, the police have not followed the procedure under Section 41 CrPC,” a police officer said.
Interestingly, on June 12, WJH police forwarded an accused identified as Choi Kyndait of Khliehtyrshi village arrested under section 380 IPC which happens to be the same section that Ali was booked under. However, the court of the CJM remanded the accused to judicial custody."

1184,Cases can be transferred from District Council Court to Civil Court: HC,"Friday, June 19, 2015","SHILLONG: The Single Bench of the Meghalaya High Court on Thursday stated that there is no bar to transfer a case from the District Council Court to a normal Civil Court.
The case in point is that of one Ram Sunder Devi from Baridua, Ri Bhoi who filed a petition for transfer of title suit no.1 of 2007 regarding the possession of property from the subordinate District Council Court, Shillong, to the general competent Court, Nongpoh.
However, there were two other claimants of the property.
The respondent No.1 Lucy Sawkmie from Baridua also filed the title suit against the respondent no.2 Gudhuli Sohpdang also from Baridua for declaration of the former’s right, title and interest and also for permanent injunction in respect of the land measuring about 20,000 sq.ft of 9th mile, Baridua.
Along with the title suit, the respondent No.1 Sawkmie also filed an application for grant of a temporary injunction which was registered as misc case No.1/2007. The temporary injunction was granted on 5.10.2007 restraining the respondent No.2, her agent or any person acting through or under her from entering into the suit land and from interfering with it from any manner.
The respondent no.1 Sawkmie claimed the land of the petitioner Devi and enforced the injunction dated 5.10.2007 order against Devi and she was not allowed to construct the house over her land.
The petitioner tried to be impleaded in the title suit but she was not allowed by the District Council Court on the ground that she being a non tribal could not be impleaded in the title suit. The petitioner has been suffering on account of the injunction order. The petitioner felt that unless the title suit is transferred to the general competent civil court, she will not be able to get any relief.
Hearing both the parties, the Justice Sen said, “High Court has the power to transfer any case from one court to another court and there is no bar to transfer a case from the District Council Court to a normal Civil Court”.
Justice Sen in his order stated that it is a fact that when a dispute arises between two tribals in an autonomous area, the matter is to be tried by the District Council Court.
Justice Sen said that the question remains that since the petitioner wants to implead herself in  the  case, whether  she  can  be  refused  to  be impleaded  as  one  of the party because  she  has  got  the  interest over the title  suit pending before the District Council Court?
“If she is not allowed to be impleaded in the title suit pending before the District Council or the case is not transferred to the normal Civil Court, then she will  have no place to get remedy and she will remain remediless,” Justice Sen said.
According to the court, no one can be remediless before the Court of law and that there must be remedy somewhere.
“The peculiar system of law prevailing in the State of Meghalaya, cannot be a hindrance for anyone to be  remediless,” the High Court said.
According to Justice Sen, Meghalaya High Court Rules, 2014, adopted a chapter under the caption of High Court of Meghalaya  (Jurisdiction Over  District  Council  Courts) Order, 2014 and while  going through Section 7 of the said Chapter, it is understood and clear that High Court  has the power to transfer a case from one Court to another Court to meet the ends of justice.
Earlier, the counsel for the petitioner, P Upadhaya, contended that as per Section 7 of  the High Court of Meghalaya (Jurisdiction Over District Council Courts) Order, 2014, the High Court has the power to transfer the suit from one Court to another or to any other Court.
However, he could not place any citation on the matter. According to the counsel for the petitioner, initially a title suit was initiated before the Court of the District Council, Shillong where both parties are tribals.
Subsequently, the petitioner  tried  to implead  herself  into  the  suit as she has got  certain interest on the title suit, but  the  same was rejected on the ground that the petitioner was a non tribal and District Council Court can adjudicate matters only between tribals.
On the other  hand,  senior  counsel,  GS  Massar, appearing for and on behalf of the respondent No.1, submitted that as per United Khasi -Jaintia Hills  Autonomous  District  (Administration  of  Justice) Rules, 1953, the District Council Court has the jurisdiction only to  decide the disputes between tribals and the District Council Court has no power to decide and redress the  grievances  of  non  tribals  and  there  is  no provision that the case can be transferred from the District Council Court to normal Civil Court."

Police, after receiving inputs, carried out a surprise raid on the village on Wednesday and arrested the six gang members.
The six have been identified as Salem Marak (19), Dolen Sangma (18), Plan Ch Momin (18), Jenggat Ch Momin (18), Liken Ch Marak (19) and Prewil Ch Momin (18) all hailing from Mibonpara village.
“They could not provide the name and other details of the trader but they have confessed that their leader is Salsal Momin, who has close association with militant groups,” West Garo Hills Additional Superintendent of Police, Bruno A Sangma said.
According to Sangma the gang was paid an amount of Rs 5 lakh as ransom for the trader’s release along with which Salsal is still absconding.
The gang is also suspected to have been involved in the recent kidnapping of two teachers, Naresh and Niren Koch from Dalu. While Naresh managed to escape from his captors on Monday by faking a ‘call of nature’, Niren is believed to be still under their captivity and may have been taken to Bangladesh.

It is not known what transpired in the meeting since the NPP sources did not want to speak to the press before the ECI takes further decision on the matter.
The party leaders are, however, hopeful that the problem will be resolved.
The NPP, an alliance partner of the ruling NDA at the Centre, is a recognized state party in Meghalaya. An EC official explained that if the NPP is able to satisfy the poll body by filing ‘appropriate’ statement, the suspension of recognition can be withdrawn.
The ECI on Tuesday had suspended the recognition of Purno Agitok Sangma’s National People’s Party for failing to file its election expenditure statement.
This is for the first time that the poll watchdog has taken such a step of suspending recognition of a party using its powers under Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968 “for its failure to follow the Lawful directions of the Commission,” EC said in a statement.
NPP leader Conrad Sangma on Wednesday informed that party’s national secretary, treasurers and its lawyers will submit necessary documents on Thursday which should satisfy the Election Commission.

1207,HC cautions WGH SP on freezing of bank account,"Thursday, June 18, 2015","Petition by wife of GNLA leader
SHILLONG: The High Court of Meghalaya has cautioned West Garo Hills SP MK Singh for freezing the bank account of the wife of a police official turned rebel leader Savio Marak.
Marak had deserted the police and joined GNLA.
During the hearing of the case on June 16, the petitioner Jimbe R. Marak through her lawyer S. Dey had submitted that the police was harassing the petitioner by freezing her bank account.
However, the government advocate K.P. Bhattacharjee, submitted that the petitioner now is withdrawing money and operating the bank account since 31.01.2014 and the account was frozen only for a few months.
However, hearing both the parties the Judge SR Sen said that he is of the opinion that before freezing an account of any person, it is necessary for the freezing authority to enquire into the matter  so that, “the aggrieved party/account holder will know the reason for which, his or her account has been frozen .
“We cannot freeze the account of a person on mere suspicion because it may cause hardship to the account holder. We must remember that in law we must act in a manner as law desires, otherwise not. Since there is no allegation that, till date the said account has been operated by the petitioner’s husband or any other militant, she is hereby allowed to operate her account freely,” the Judge observed.
The SP West Garo Hills, and State Bank of India, Williamnagar Branch, East Garo Hills represented by its Branch Manager have also been directed not to be a hindrance in the operation of the account until it is required and it should be in accordance with law.
“I hereby dispose of this matter with a caution to SP West Garo Hills district not to repeat the same in future,” the Judge added."

1213,Entire family among 5 dead in Tura landslides,"Wednesday, June 17, 2015","TURA: Five people, including an entire family, have been killed in two separate landslide incidents in Tura triggered by incessant rains which lashed many parts of Garo Hills since Monday night.
Tragedy struck the home of the Chettri’s at Nakham Bazaar at 6:20 on Tuesday morning when the storm was at its peak. Huge tons of mud and boulders came crashing down from the above cliffs completely destroying the home.
Mother Pinky Chettri (34), a widow, along with her three children – sons Bijoy (19) and Rohan (11) and daughter Priya (15) – could not make it out to safety and were buried alive beneath the mudslide.
Their bodies were retrieved by locals and emergency workers.
Eldest son Bijoy reportedly tried to rescue his younger siblings when the first cave in took place, according to neighbours who shared the same premises on rent.
Hearing their cries for help, the eldest son had rushed back inside when a second wave of landslide came crashing down burying him alive with his mother and younger siblings.
Daughter Priya was studying in Gorkha High School. They had moved into the ill-fated house less than six months ago.
Another casualty occurred in Akonggre locality of the town in which a retired policeman, Chotelal Prasad (70), lost his life after sustaining injuries caused by a landslide.
Chotelal Prasad was severely injured after boulders fell on his house and was rushed to Tura Civil Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.
In the light of the twin tragedies the district administration has announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs.4 lakh for each of the victims who died in Tuesday’s tragedy at Tura.
Apart from Tura, the storm caused extensive damage to the East Garo Hills road linking Tura at Samanda.
A sub-way near Samanda Market which was being used for  vehicular traffic got washed away in the morning storm halting movement of all vehicles. A temporary arrangement has been made over the new RCC bridge to allow small vehicles to ply through while work gets underway to restore the sub-way by early Wednesday morning.
Barring Tura, no untoward incidents have been reported from the rest of the four districts of Garo Hills due to the thunderstorm.
This is the second major incident of human loss caused by landslides in Tura in the last few years.
On July 27, 2007, a similar incident occurred across the Rongkhon river bank in Nakham Bazar, less than a km away from the site of Tuesday’s incident, in which boulders came crashing down from 200 feet above onto a house at Rishipara locality that was housing several dozen families.
The landslide at Rishipara crushed human dwellings and pushed an entire section of the house into the river which was in spate sweeping the inhabitants away. Eight people, including three little children, were killed in that tragedy.
In both cases, unregulated earth cutting along sides of cliffs is believed to be the main reason behind the landslides.
With Tuesday’ landslide resulting in the death of five persons in Tura in West Garo Hills, the death toll owing to natural calamities in the State has risen to 13.
An official statement said on Tuesday that due to incessant heavy rain, landslides occurred in some places of East Jaintia Hills and East Khasi Hills districts resulting in the loss of three lives in East Khasi Hills and four in East Jaintia Hills during the past week.
In another incident, one person died and five others were injured due to lightning strike in South West Garo Hills District.
Ex-gratia payment to the next of kin of the deceased persons as per the norms is being made by the respective deputy commissioners, the government added.

1214,EC derecognizes NPP,"Wednesday, June 17, 2015","New Delhi: The Election Commission on Tuesday suspended the recognition of Purno Agitok Sangma’s National People’s Party for failing to file its election expenditure statement.
This is for the first time that the poll watchdog has taken such a step of suspending recognition of a party using its powers under Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968 “for its failure to follow the Lawful directions of the Commission,” EC said in a statement.
The National People’s Party, an alliance partner of the ruling NDA, is a recognised state party in Meghalaya.
An EC official explained that if the NPP is able to satisfy the poll body by filing ‘appropriate’ statement, the suspension of recognition can be withdrawn.
“It is a final notice before derecognition. We will now treat the party as derecognised for the time being…the party has not been derecognised as such,” he explained.
Following a Supreme Court judgement in the case of Common Cause Vs Union of India, EC had earlier issued instructions to all political parties to file their election expenditure statement within 75 days of assembly elections and 90 days of Lok Sabha elections.
It pointed out that the election to Lok Sabha, 2014 and elections to the Legislative Assemblies of Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Odisha and Sikkim, 2014 was completed on May 28, 2014 and as per the Commission’s instructions, the political parties were required to submit their election expenditure statements in connection with the above elections by August 26, 2014.
The Commission had issued two reminders to the National People’s Party to submit the required statement for Lok Sabha election 2014 after the due date had long expired on August 26, 2014.
Finally, the Election Commission issued a notice on March 17, 2015 to the party to show cause as to why action should not be taken under Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order 1968 for failure to follow the lawful directions and instructions of the Commission.
The party had requested time to submit its expenditure statement by April 15, 2015 and again by May 15, 2015 ‘but failed to honour the deadline’. (PTI)"

At that time the Estate had only one bungalow and an out house, where a second bungalow now stands. The inscription on one of the monoliths states that as per Assam Archives, Lyndhurst Estate was purchased by Inanoda Sundari Chaudharani of Goalpara in 1927 from Elsie James.

1222,‘Digital India’ a far cry for NE India,"Wednesday, June 17, 2015","Shillong: Call drops are a familiar part of our lives. The internet still functions at snail’s pace despite lofty promises and colourful hoardings about speedy internet connectivity.
Leading the pack is Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) with its promise to connect India but cannot connect people in the same house.
A long standing customer of BSNL, R. Nongbri, says she finds it appalling that there is no mobile connectivity once she crosses Umiam and until she reaches Nongpoh. Then after crossing Nongpoh there is no connection until she reaches Byrnihat and that too is unstable.
Another consumer, B. Nongrum of Jaiaw says that mobile and internet service providers compel their clients to keep two numbers from two different companies. He has a BSNL and Airtel number because if he is stranded along the Shillong-Guwahati highway he cannot rely on his BSNL number only. “Experience has taught me that if I am in trouble on the highway, I cannot rely on BSNL,” Nongrum told this correspondent.
The less said about internet connectivity the better. Newspaper offices and all other service providers like banks etc., have a standard complaint. The internet is either down or moving extremely slowly.
A senior state government official who did not wish to be named said, “How can we ever expect to start e-governance services when even in the state capital of Shillong internet connectivity is still very poor? Is the Prime Minister aware of this extremely pathetic internet service when he promised Digital India in his manifesto and his ‘Maan Ki Baat’? ”
BSNL top brass in Shillong allege that the problem began with the UPA government and its spectrum sale to private companies while depriving BSNL of an equal playing field. It is learnt that equipments sent to the Northeastern state usually become redundant very quickly. In fact this is an area and space where redundancy sets in very quickly.
Mid and senior level engineers of BSNL, many of who have to bear the brunt of customers’ ire, are at their wits end. According to them the total Meghalaya Broadband & FTTH Service is dependent on skeleton slow speed service owing to the repeated failure of the main link.
Their question is that when the world is communicating on speedy Internet service why can’t BSNL provide the speed and the Bandwidth to the people of the North East?
They attribute the problem to the repeated failure of 2.5 GE   ETR Guwahati- Kolkata data link from NIB Guwahati which has been failing every day for the last three months. The network has been totally down from May 18 last and has been performing sub-optimally since then.
Along with this 2.5 GE ETR Data Links (INTERNET) from NIB nodes of Shillong, Silchar, Dimapur, Jorhat and Tezpur are also down, they informed.
Broadband services of Shillong & Guwahati are passing through PGCIL links which are insufficient to bear the traffic. All the PGCIL links are highly choked with more than 100% load.
They say that Broadband services in the entire North Eastern Region is severely affected leading to huge backlogs of customer complaints.
“The matter has been raised with the ETR Management, Srihari Roy, CGM ETR Kolkata who is responsible for long distance communication of NE Region several times over but with no positive results,” a BSNL officer informed, adding that ETR Headquarters at Kolkata is neglecting this grave issue of North Eastern Region.
Apparently the connectivity is linked with Bangalore-Kolkata-NER. They say immediate steps are needed to bring the Guwahati-Kolkata Internet Link along with others into satisfactory operational level.
The CGMT Assam Circle has proposed to BSNL CO to provide 10 GE Data from PGCIL to overcome this alarming situation. BSNL officers claim that mass exodus of Broadband customers cannot be avoided if this situation continues. They informed that the matter has been taken up by Executive Association with the CMD, BSNL but to no avail.
Meanwhile an online citizens’ group called North East Digital Forum has been formed to put pressure on the Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Forum feels that a systems overhaul is needed in the North East and that BSNL must perform or perish. “Considering that all service providers ride on the BSNL system it is important for BSNL to deliver to its customers,” a member of the Forum said."

1231,Fight against corruption takes back seat,"Tuesday, June 16, 2015","Lokayukta a non starter, Vigilance panel almost defunct in M’laya
SHILLONG: An almost defunct State Vigilance Commission and absence of the Lokayukta in Meghalaya has deterred any vibrant anti corruption initiative in the State.
While the formation of Lokayukta is yet to become a reality, the State Vigilance Commission has become powerless as official records show that till date only 8 corruption cases involving public servants were registered and investigated by the Vigilance Commission but without a single conviction.
In the absence of the Lokayukta, the Anti- Corruption Branch of the Meghalaya Police under the supervision of CID formed as per Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998 is carrying out investigation into the corruption cases involving public servants.
However, the post of DIG under the Anti- Corruption Branch is lying vacant and the current Deputy SP in charge Anti- Corruption Branch is engaged in anti-insurgency operations instead of investigating corruption cases. While there are only three inspectors, the number of constables is 4, official data said.  Moreover, there is no autonomy for the Anti- Corruption Branch.
Regarding the Lokayukta, the State Government had in March last year passed the Meghalaya Lokayukta Bill, 2014, but the actual Lokayukta is yet to take shape.
An official said on Monday that as far as formation of the Lokayukta is concerned, the process has been delayed since the five-member search committee empowered to select the Chairperson and other members of the Lokayukta had failed to meet.
The search committee had been appointed by a Government Selection Committee.
The search committee, after preparing a panel of names, will have to forward the same to the selection committee for the appointment of a Chairperson and four members of Lokayukta.
As per the Meghalaya Lokayukta Bill, 2014 passed by the government in March 2014, besides four members, the Lokayukta will consist of the Chairperson, who is or has been a Chief Justice of the High Court or a Judge of the High Court or an eminent person who fulfils the eligibility of having impeccable integrity and knowledge of anti-corruption policy for at least 25 years”.
The eminent person should have “outstanding ability having special knowledge and expertise of not less than 25 years in the matters relating to anti-corruption policy, public administration, vigilance, finance including insurance and banking, law and management”.
While the term of the Chairman and four members is five years, they can remain in office till the age of 70 as per the Lokayukta Act. The minimum age of the Chairperson and the members should be 45 years."

Maksingh Wahlang (67) of Umsaw village had filed an FIR earlier claiming that he had been tortured, threatened and ostracized by the village Dorbar after he was accused of practicing witchcraft.
However, no action was taken by the police compelling the victim to file a fresh complaint with Nongstoin police on Friday last. Acting on the second complaint, Police arrested Phlander Lyngkhoi (61), Sordar, and Distar Shangoi Syiem (53), Secretary of Umsaw village.
The duo was on Monday remanded in judicial custody.
In his complaint to police, Wahlang stated that the Dorbar had forcefully asked him to submit a letter in October 2012 mentioning that he wanted to leave the village on his own.
“Out of fear I submitted the letter since the Dorbar had threatened to pour boiling water on me,” Wahlang, who is a   father of nine children, said, adding that the Dorbar had also imposed a fine of Rs.20, 000 on him.
Wahlang further informed that he had, earlier, sought the intervention of the Additional Subordinate District Court in the matter.
Acting on the petition, the court has directed the Dorbar Shnong of Umsaw village to refund the fine imposed on him.
However, the Sordar filed an appeal before the District Council Court against the order of the lower court. The matter is still pending before the KHADC court."

Rymbai, for taking undue advantages of his power as the Rangbah Shnong to threatened people and to illegally claim land belonging to the villagers to usurp compensation awarded for the Jowai Bypass.
A group of women including    Arlin Dkhar and Dita Phawa, both social workers of Khliehtyrshi village, have complained that the Rangbah Shnong had threatened them with dire consequences.
“He came to meet me and threatened to harm me if I did not stop my job as a social worker,” Arlin Dkhar stated in her complaint.
“I had become his enemy as soon as I protested against his illegal move of grabbing the land belonging to my fellow villagers, particularly those who are illiterate and living below the poverty line,” Dita Phwa informed.
“He has recommended many non tribals for PDS and also granted them the right to vote for the district council elections in Jaintia Hills,” Dkhar alleged.
The women’s group urged the West Jaintia Hills district administration to properly verify the JHADC electoral rolls which, they said, was the same as the electoral rolls of the Assembly elections.
The women’s group led by Dkhar and Phawa had lodged a complaint on May 30 but the case was transferred to the Women’s Police Cell in Jowai PS as the FIR stated that the Rangbah Shnong had abused and threatened a woman.
On Monday, both the parties were summoned to Jowai PS but they failed to agree on a compromise.
“The Rangbah Shnong has understood his wrong doings and now he wants a compromised but we want the court of law to provide us justice,” said Dkhar, while urging the police to take action on the FIR instead of summoning both the parties for compromise.
“Who are they (police) to force us to compromise; let the court of law decide what we should do,” she said."

1239,Union Govt to come out with national policy on drug demand reduction,"Tuesday, June 16, 2015","SHILLONG: Taking cognizance of the growing menace of drug abuse in the country, the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment would soon come out with a ‘National Policy on Drug Demand Reduction’.
Informing this here on Monday during the first regional workshop on ‘Prevention of Substance (Drugs) Abuse’ in the North East held here, Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment Thaawarchand Gehlot asserted that the policy would benefit the Government, NGOs and other stakeholders.
Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown deep concern over the menace of drug abuse among youth, the union minister said building awareness and sensitizing the youths on drug abuse prevention is the need of the hour even as he also assured the State Government that the Centre will work in coordination with the states to take on the menace of drug abuse.
Gehlot also informed that India has close proximity to two major opium cultivating areas – the Golden Crescent (Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan) in the West and the Golden Triangle (Myanmar-Laos-Thailand) in the East – which makes it a region of transit as well as destination for illicit drugs.
Gehlot further informed that the Ministry has designated 12 NGOs having wide experience in the field of prevention of drug abuse as Regional Resource and Training Centres (RRTCs) in different regions of the country which include three in the North East – Nagaland, Mizoram and Manipur.
The de-addiction and rehabilitation centres are run by the NGOs, which are assisted by the Ministry under the Central Sector Scheme for Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, Gehlot said.
Gehlot observed with dismay that in the North East several NGOs were working in the field of drug abuse prevention in Manipur but there was no voluntary organization active in other states like Tripura.
“I request the representatives of these states to have a look at this and identify the pockets of drug abuse and recommend the organizations genuinely working in this field to get assistance from the Ministry,” he said while informing that presently the Ministry provides financial assistance of approximately Rs. 4 crore to around 50 NGOs in the North East.
Pointing out that the menace of drug abuse and alcoholism was a matter of concern for all, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Vijay Sampla, said, “Drug abuse and illicit trafficking continue to have a profoundly negative impact on development and stability across the world.”
‘Cannabis being cultivated in N-E’
Gehlot also stated that cultivation of ganja (cannabis) was taking place in some states of the North East.
Speaking to media persons on the sidelines of the regional workshop, the union minister said cultivation of ganja must be stopped at the earliest. He, however, refused to divulge the names of the states where ganja cultivation was going on.
Reacting to a query on the survey of drug addicts in Meghalaya and across the country, the minister said that conducting survey for drug abuse is difficult since every one denies that he /she is a drug addict.
Stating that the Centre, through the State Government, was conducting a special campaign in Meghalaya, Manipur and Nagaland to identify the drug addicts, Gehlot said more special campaigns will be organized in 2015-16 to identify drug addicts and provide them necessary treatment and other rehabilitations.
Asked about the survey of disabled people in the country, the union minister said that the Centre has expanded the list of diseases labeled as disability from 7 to 19.
Gehlot informed that the Ministry has decided to issue a universal multipurpose card at all-India level for the disable people and even an agency has been appointed for the purpose.
“We will start the survey from next month to identify disabled people,” he said, adding that the Ministry also intends to provide modern facilities in old age homes across the country.
The workshop is being organised by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in collaboration with the Meghalaya Government and the National Service Scheme. Senior officers from the ministry, Meghalaya Government and NGOs from different parts of the State were present on the occasion."

The celebration was attended by Unitarian leaders from America, Europe and from across the country. Recalling the works and life of Hajom Kissor Singh, Sahitya Akademi member and principal of St Edmund’s College, Sylvanus Lamare, rued the fact that the man who was instrumental in promoting the Khasi language over 100 years ago was not given the credit he deserved.
“He has not been given the recognition due to him. Even history books do not say much about him. It is unfair on our part not to recognise the contribution of Singh towards the promotion and preservation of Khasi language,” Lamare, who has done a research on the life and works of Singh, said.
He said Hajom Kissor Singh, along with his aides and contemporaries – U Soso Tham and S Challam – were the first Khasi officials to have jointly written to the British government in 1902 to allow the use of Khasi as a medium of instruction and also its use in examinations in Upper Primary School.
Addressing the gathering, Chief Advisor to the State Government, DD Lapang, who was the chief guest on the occasion, said that there is still so much to know and learn about the great Hajom Kissor Singh. He lamented rued that some are not interested to learn and know about him due to prejudices.
“But his teachings will never be irrelevant,” Lapang added.
Born to parents who were practicing the indigenous faith in Saitsohpen at Sohra, in 1865, Singh converted to Christianity at the young age of 15 before he founded the Khasi Unitarian movement in 1887.
“The first hymn book in Khasi language containing readings and songs he wrote was considered as one of the finest books written in simple Khasi language,” Lamare said.
A government servant during the British rule, H K Singh was described as a ‘brilliant young man’ whose sincerity and honesty enabled him to occupy high ranks and positions."

However, in one of the latest cases that has come to light, a family hailing from Khlieh Umtrew under Mawhati constituency in Ri-Bhoi district has been socially ostracized for almost two decades at the order of the Village Dorbar.
The family of Markaret Jarain was socially ostracized in 1995 after they had raised questions over the decision taken by the Seng Kynthei to collect Rs.2 per head from each resident of the village.
B. Jarain, son of Markaret Jarain, on Sunday informed that his mother (Markaret) had questioned the Seng Kynthei over the decision to collect the money from each resident since she had not attended a meeting of the Seng Kynthei where the decision had been taken.
However, the members of the Seng Kynthei were very angry at her behavior and asked her to pay the amount without any question, Jarain informed.
Following the incident, the Seng Kynthei complained to the executive committee of the Village Dorbar which immediately ordered Markaret’s family to be ostracized from the village.
Following the ostracism order, the family was denied access to the drinking water supply, access to various government schemes including PDS and was also prevented from maintaining any relationship with the villagers, a member of the victimized family said, while adding that even the grocery shops in the village boycotted them in view of the diktat of the Dorbar.
All attempts to reach the Rangbah Shnong of the village, D.L. Nonglait, proved to be unsuccessful as the mobile number registered in his name was no longer in use."

It was on September 24, 2014 that two persons including a woman were killed and seven others injured at Mookhep village in East Jaintia Hills when police fired at a mob which had blocked the National Highway protesting against the arrest of a person from Wapungskur village in connection with the attack on police and the magistrate the previous day during the economic blockade against the apathy of the Government in addressing the issues related to ban on coal mining.
The deceased have been identified as Derestmon Siangshai and Setlang Phawa.
The government had ordered a magisterial probe following the incident.
The magisterial inquiry report was submitted to the government in November last year by East Jaintia Hills Addl. Deputy Commissioner S.S. Syiemlieh who carried out the investigation.
Though pressure groups had demanded that the report of the magisterial probe should be made public, the Government instead went ahead with setting up of another inquiry, stating that it was not satisfied with the first probe.  An official source said on Sunday that the second probe headed by Commissioner and Secretary, Urban Affairs department, D.P. Wahlang did not even take off as no one came to file any complaints.
It was in March this year that the State Government had entrusted the probe to Wahlang who later sought more time to complete the task.
The Government had also issued notices though newspapers urging the people to come forward to give their statements, but in vain.
According to the source, Wahlang had written to the Political department last week seeking advice on the next course of action since the probe had not moved at all.
Despite the government stating that there were defects in the first magisterial inquiry into the incident, the relatives of the deceased and the injured together with the pressure groups have been insisting that the report should be made public which, however, has been rejected by the government."

Sources said the nine-time Lok Sabha MP and former Meghalaya chief minister, whose National People’s Party is part of the NDA, held wide-ranging discussions with Shah on the northeast states and sought to expand the NDA base there.
Sangma was NDA’s joint candidate for the Presidential poll and was defeated by incumbent Pranab Mukherjee.
He was one of the leaders who formed the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) headed by Sharad Pawar, after quitting Congress.
Sangma is keen on development of northeast sector and had last month led an all-party delegation of northeast MPs to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The percentage of beneficiaries identified under the scheme in the rural areas is 77.79 while in urban areas it is 50.87.

1270,Baghmara cut off from Tura,"Sunday, June 14, 2015","TURA: The South Garo Hills district has gone further distant from Tura with the main road connecting the two district headquarters closed down due to a weak bridge and a sub-way failing to provide any alternative.
A sub-way constructed at Jatrakona, approximately10 kms from Dalu, gave way to pressure forcing authorities to close down the road to traffic.
The sub-way was constructed to allow traffic to flow while PWD staff were to repair the main bridge at Jatrakona but even that failed to hold ground for reasons best known to the public works department which was tasked with coming up with the second route.
Officials from Baghmara informed that it will take around four days for the sub-way route to be restored.
Those travelling between Baghmara and Tura will now have to utilise either the poorly maintained Chokpot road or take the longer route via Nangalbibra after passing through Williamnagar in East Garo Hills.
Even the border road from Dalu to Baghmara, maintained by the BSF, is reportedly in a bad condition with several weak bridges.
South Garo Hills is plagued with poor road connectivity and has the largest share of old wooden bridges in the Garo Hills.
Only recently two wooden bridges, Tellakali bridge at Angratuli and the Dumnikora bridge, sustained damage restricting the flow of vehicular traffic to and from Baghmara."

1286,Under-14 children in city join campaign against amendment to child labour laws,"Saturday, June 13, 2015","SHILLONG: Children under the banner of Child Right Movement, Shillong, have joined a campaign to oppose the amendments to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2012 approved by the Union Cabinet on May 13 last.
The Union Cabinet has approved an amendment in the Child Labour Act, 1986, to allow children below 14 years of age to work in non-hazardous industries run by family, including agriculture and home-based work, forest gathering, etc.
The amendment also allows children to work in audio-visual and entertainment industry, including advertisements, films, television serials or any other entertainment, which can include traumatic and hazardous situations, without specifying the regulation required for this.
Children working as domestic help in various households in the city and those helping their parents in performing their jobs on Friday come forward to observe the Anti-Child Labour Day and raised their opposition to this move of the Union Government.
“We strongly oppose the move by the Centre to bring an amendment to this Act. We feel that this is a great injustice to the wellbeing of children under 14 years of age,” said a 13-year-old girl, working as a domestic help with a family in Mawlai.
Expressing similar concerns, a 12-year-old girl questioned the decision by the Union Cabinet to allow children below 14 years of age to take up jobs besides continuing with their studies.
“Children are expected to work and also concentrate on their studies at the same time. I fail to understand how these young minds will be able to cope with this kind of pressure,” said the girl who doubles up as a domestic help along with her mother after returning from school daily.
Another 12-year-old lamented the Central government’s decision to allow children below 14 years of age to work.
“Being an orphan I understand the pains of working as a domestic help in any household. I will not like children of my age to face the same crisis like me,” she said while informing that her father had abandoned her soon after her mother passed away.
She added that it was quite difficult to focus on studies when one has to work from morning till late at night.
A 13-year-old girl wondered why the Centre was allowing children below 14 years to work when the Right to Education (RTE) speaks of free and compulsory education for all children till 14 years of age.
“The Centre is talking about allowing children less than 14 years of age to work. I am confused about the policy of our Government,” she added.
Wanpynhun Kharsyntiew, programme coordinator, North Eastern Regional Domestic Workers’ Movement (NERDWM), said that the campaign in Shillong was part of a nation-wide campaign to oppose the decision of the Union Cabinet to bring the amendment to the Child Labour Act.
She observed that when children come home from school, they need to rest, play, do their homework and in general enjoy the delights of carefree childhood, and pushing them to spend these post-school hours, weekends and holidays at work was not a wise call.
“We feel that it is a justice to the young children since they will have to work for four to five hours a day after their school. It will take a toll on these children both physically and mentally,” Kharsyntiew said.
Admitting that it is difficult to improve the situation, she said that as a society, the people are not forthcoming to improve the well being of the children who come from difficult backgrounds.
She lamented that the children of artisans and rag pickers will remain to be artisans and rag pickers.
“At the end, we will not be able to eliminate child labour,” Kharsyntiew said.
She batted for public consultation on the amendment and called for removal of the provision seeking to legitimize use of children less than 14 years as labour in family enterprises out of their school hours and during vacation.
Kharsyntiew said that they will soon meet the Governor to submit a representation expressing their opposition to the proposed amendments.
She further informed that they have identified around 650 children under 14 years of age who are working as domestic help in the city alone."

1290,Garo body urges Guv to facilitate ‘inclusion of rights’ in VAB,"Saturday, June 13, 2015","SHILLONG: The Secretary of the Malor Association of the Dwara Nongtyrnem Sirdarship under Mawsynram, Carlos D Sangma has urged Governor V Shanmuganathan to facilitate inclusion of the suitable provisions, to preserve the customary rights and practices of the Garo/Achik villagers and other tribes residing within the jurisdiction of the KHADC, in the original KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2012.
“On behalf of the Garo/Achik population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of the KHADC, I would like to urge you to include suitable provisions for the protection the customary rights and practices of the the Garo/Achik villagers and other tribes in the VAB,” Sangma said in a representation submitted to the Governor on Friday.
He observed that there are several villages within the Khasi Hills region which are dominated by the Garo/Achik villages and other tribes such as Hajongs, Banais and Koch.
“There are more than a thousand Garo/Achik villages within the territory of the KHADC enlisted in the annexure I and II of the VAB, 2012. These villages are being headed by molor/morol (Garo/Achik headman),” secretary of the Malor Association of the Dwara Nongtyrnem Sirdarship said.
According to him, since time immemorial, the customary practice in Dwara Nongtyrnem allowed villages to elect their own molor/morol who is then approved by the Sirdar’s office and the KHADC Executive Committee.

1301,"It’s final, Meghalaya to co-host SAF Games","Friday, June 12, 2015","SHILLONG: Meghalaya is all set to co-host the 12th edition of the South Asian Federation (SAF) Games with Assam. The SAF Games will be held tentatively in the last week of November.
The decision to finalize the venues for the mega sporting event was taken at a meeting which was held at New Delhi on June 8.
The conduct of the games in the State came under severe doubt when Assam expressed its inability in hosting the games. However, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi later said that the state government will extend all help for holding the SAF Games.
The last SAF games were held in Dhaka in 2010 and India was to host the next edition in 2012. However, the games were postponed following an IOC ban on the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). The ban was revoked last year after fresh elections of the IOA and plans are underway to ensure that the games are held in November this year.
The estimated budget for the games is Rs 60 crore and the IOA has asked the Centre to fund Rs 40 crore.
“It is confirmed that Meghalaya will co-host the SAF games with Assam. The mega sports event is likely to be held sometime in the last week of November,” Sports and Youth Affairs department secretary FR Kharkongor, who attended the meeting in New Delhi, told newsmen here on Thursday. He added that the event is a great opportunity for the State to experience hosting such a big event.
Around 3000 athletes along with officials representing various SAARC countries are expected to participate in the mega event.
Informing that the last edition of the game was held in Dhaka in 2010, Kharkongor said that it was the turn of Bhutan to host the games.
“After Bhutan expressed its inability to host the games, India bid for it. As part of the Look East Policy, the Centre wanted that the games should be held in the North East,” he added.
The Sports and Youth Affairs department secretary said that the team from the IOA and Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs had come to the State to inspect the infrastructure and venues in February this year.
The officials found Meghalaya fit to host the indoor games while the outdoor games will be held in Assam.
He also informed that the venue which have been approved to host the event include SAI Special Area games at NEHU, NEIGRIHMS indoor stadium and the JN Complex.
Kharkongor informed that seven events will be held in Meghalaya which include judo, wushu, archery, boxing, taekwondo, table tennis and badminton.
“People might be more attracted towards boxing and badminton considering India has players like Mary Kom, Vijender Singh, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu and P Kashyap who have excelled at the international level,” he said.
While admitting that there will be difficulties ahead considering that the State has limited time to prepare for the mega event, he said that with the assistance of the IOA and Ministry of Sports and Youths Affairs, Meghalaya will overcome the challenges.
The opening and closing ceremony of the event will be held in Assam."

Speaking to reporters, SP Vivek Syiem said that there were 14 cases in the year 2013 followed by a whopping 37 cases in 2014 and so far 12 such cases have been reported this year.
Though several advisories have been issued by the State police and respective banks urging customers to be cautious, however, cases continue to be reported where huge amounts are debited from the account of bank users.
According to Syiem, one person from the state was duped of Rs 80000 by way of such fraud.
While many bank customers continue to fall prey to con men who seek their ATM card details through phone calls. Bank authorities are finding it difficult to come up with any full-proof mechanism to stop such instances. The latest modus operandi adopted by frauds is that the criminals usually call up gullible customers and identify themselves as bank managers.
The criminals pretend that there is a problem with the ATM card of the customers and asked for the ATM and pin numbers on the pretext of changing the card and pin number and as soon as the ATM card and pin numbers are given, the customers gets a call alert on their mobile that an amount has been debited from their account.
Syiem pointed out that the banks must give counseling to each and every customer about the use of ATM.
State police has also asked banks to send letters to customers and advise them on the dos and don’t’s of ATM cards."

1333,Questions raised on Government adopting new education policy,"Thursday, June 11, 2015","TURA: Several NGOs from Garo Hills have questioned the rationality of the state government’s decision to adopt the new admission policy under UGC norms for schools and colleges in Garo Hills which has led to some colleges discontinuing the admission of students to Class XI and XII.
The NGOs which included the Tengsak led GSU, FKJGP, AYWO and ADE while acknowledging that the rules laid down by the UGC were meant to raise the quality of education, pointed out that there were many neglected areas in the North East without enough colleges to absorb all the aspiring students who seek to further their academic careers.
Reminding that repeated appeals to upgrade colleges and open new ones in Garo Hills were never fulfilled by the state government the NGOs questioned what the colleges in the region were supposed to do if the new policy was adopted.
“How are our colleges supposed to follow the teacher-student ratio of 1:25 for science classes and student-laboratory ratio of 1:15 as given by the UGC if the new policy is implemented? There are simply not enough lecturers and laboratories to fulfil the norm in GH including the rest of Meghalaya except maybe, in Shillong,” the NGOs asked adding, there were other norms also for Arts and Honours as well as the already existing policy to delink the Higher Secondary section from MBOSE.
The NGOs posed a question to the Meghalaya Government if it wanted more youths to join militancy in Garo Hills and criticised it for not improving the education infrastructure even though it knew that the existing institutions would be overburdened.
They demanded that more Lecturers are employed by the government in all Garo Hills colleges at the same time reminding that Baghmara, Williamnagar and Medipathar colleges were yet to get full fledged principals and vice principals. The NGOs also demanded that more colleges are opened in Garo Hills whatever the cost and urged it to communicate with the UGC to apprise them of the reality being faced by the students so that they can pursue their education.
The NGOs also warned of agitation if the government continues to be a mute spectator to the plight of the students.
GSU’s suggestion
Meanwhile, in view of the problems being faced by the proposed new admission policy the GSU, Tikrikilla has suggested measures to ease the sufferings of the student community of the region.
It suggested that the number of seats per honour subjects must be extended to the maximum level so that admission for all aspiring students is guaranteed under the Tikrikilla College, increase in number of faculty for the college as well as upgradation of infrastructure and increase in the number of honours subjects in the college as against the earlier three among others.
Support
to ASWA demand
In another separate statement the Captain Williamson Memorial Government College Students’ Union (CWMGCSU) has extended its firm support to the demand of the ASWA for continuation of the higher secondary section at the college including the Williamnagar Government College.
The union also warned of a joint agitation along with the ASWA if its demand was not met soon."

Tenstar Shylla, resident of Mihmyntdu, Jowai, was arrested for allegedly extorting money from a tyre workshop owner at Phramer.
President of Phramer VDP, Firstborn Sari, on Tuesday informed that members of the VDP had got information that one Md. Jainal, owner of a tyre workshop, was being tortured by some persons who claimed to be NGO members.
Md. Jainul, hailing from Bihar, informed the VDP that some people claiming to be from the NGT (National Green Tribunal) came to him and demanded money. “The first time I gave them Rs.3000 but they kept coming and I could not pay them,” the shop owner said.
“We met Md. Jainul and enquired from him. At first he denied the same but later revealed the details and with his help we were able to apprehend the JPYM president along  with two others,” the VDP president informed.
The VDP members took them to the Durbar Hall where senior members of the village interrogated them. Tenstar Shylla denied having extorted money and revealed that he had only requested the owner of the tyre shop for donation.
The VDP and the Phramer village Dorbar have strongly condemned such acts by vested persons who extort money not only from outsiders but also from their own community in the name of ‘donations’.
Sources informed that over 45 organisations are allegedly operational in Jaintia Hills.
The list of all such organisations – both active and dormant – can be easily obtained from various cement plants operating in East Jaintia Hills who regularly receive letters from such organisations seeking ‘donations’ from the companies, the sources added."

1341,Ardent dares Govt to arrest ARPA MDCs,"Wednesday, June 10, 2015","SHILLONG: Former KHADC CEM Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit has dared the State Government to arrest ARPA MDCs if it feels that they have violated the law by going ahead with their campaign to inform the people on the actual position of the modified KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2015.
“If the Government feels that the steps taken by the ARPA MDCs is unconstitutional then why they did not arrest us?” Basaiawmoit stated while reacting to a recent statement of the State Government arguing that the elected representatives had taken an oath to abide by the Constitution.
The State Government had made this remark while specifically referring to the demand of the ARPA for re-inclusion of sub section 8 and 16 of Section 5 in the VAB by claiming that it is in conflict with the Fundamental Rights as clearly specified in Article 19 of the Constitution.
“This is a clear attempt to mislead the people and also to suppress their (ARPA) plan to go to the masses and explain them the actual position of the VAB,” the former CEM said.
He also maintained that the Fundamental Rights as enshrined in Article 19 were not absolute rights.
“We are not playing politics. The world knows who is playing politics. If you want to define the Constitution it should be from the beginning till the end,” he stated.    “If the incorporation of the two deleted sections of the VAB is unconstitutional then the Reservation Policy, the Scheduled Tribe status and United Khasi-Jaintia Trading By Non-Tribals Regulation, 1954 are all unconstitutional,” he argued.
“The people who were responsible for designing the Constitution had given a deep thought on the need to protect the microscopic indigenous community. It is for this reason that they had come up with the Sixth Schedule to preserve and protect our distinct culture, custom and our identity,” he said.
Pointing out that Nagaland and Mizoram have Article 371 A and G of the Constitution to protect their religious or social practices, customary law and procedure and transfer of land and its resources, Basaiawmoit said, “We also need Article 371 to protect us. Sadly, the Dorbar Shnong have not been able to function as per the prevailing traditions and practices following the intervention of the court.  Therefore, I feel that the indigenous people need to be united to voice their concern on this very important issue,” he said.
ARPA Chairman Metbah Lyngdoh said, “As elected representatives, we have conducted a thorough study of whatever we are clarifying. We found that these deleted clauses are in no way conflicting with any existing laws or infringes the fundamental rights of anybody.”
Referring to Article 19 of the Constitution, he said, “Clause 5 of this Article clearly allows us to protect and safeguard the identity of our indigenous community.”"

The police requested all concerned citizens including businessmen to immediately inform police of any extortion bid or demand received from the HNLC so as to enable the police to thwart attempts of the outfit to rear its head again."

The rally, which was held at the Chandmary playground was attended by leaders of various Garo Hills-based NGOs like the GHSMC, PGSU, AYWO, ASWA and AAYF among others who questioned the applicability of the semester system in Garo Hills in view of the region’s poor educational infrastructure.
The new norms affect admissions into Class XI and general degree courses as the semester system calls for adequate infrastructure and proper educationists. Most colleges have withdrawn their Class XI sections in anticipation of the changed norms as the implementation would need the requisite infrastructure.
The gathering felt that switching to the new policy would be detrimental to the student community due to absence of enough schools and colleges in Garo Hills.
In the wake of the new policy, two government colleges at Williamnagar in East Garo Hills and Baghmara in South Garo Hills have stopped admissions for higher secondary classes.
GSU northern zone president, Rupa M Marak said that adopting the policy would result in many students dropping out of schools and joining militant groups.
GHSMC chairman, Nikman Ch Marak added that while the semester system had its advantages in other  places, it could not be accepted in Garo Hills due to lack of infrastructure.

Informing this here on Monday, an official source said that the Governor is carefully examining the Bill before giving his seal.
It was on Friday last that the district council affairs department forwarded the Bill to the Governor for his approval.
The major changes among others made in the original Bill is the deletion of Section 5( VIII) which stipulates the duration of stay of 14 years for any non-Khasi resident to get residential certificates.
Another major deletion was section 5(XVI) which says that “the Executive Committee in recognition of the customary practices prevailing within the Hima(s) or Raid(s) or Village(s) may from time to time by notification prescribe the restrictions, terms and conditions of entry of a person other than a tribal native resident”.

1365,No scam in release of ad: DIPR,"Tuesday, June 9, 2015","SHILLONG: The Director of Information and Public Relations said on Monday that there is no scam brewing with the Directorate of Information & Public Relations over the advertisement of Tender Notices issued in the national newspapers to publish the Umiam- Jorabat Expressway Project Tender Notices on behalf of the PWD (Roads), Government of Meghalaya.
In a statement issued to here on Monday in reaction to a news item published in this daily,  the Director said that in the year 2008, three firms  M/s Magnum Intergrafiks Private Ltd, M/s Advertising Private Ltd (EPS) and M/s Omega Advertising Agency (Press) Private Ltd were empanelled as Advertising Agency by the then DIPR.
“M/s Magnum Intergrafiks Private Ltd was issued with the order for advertisement on behalf of PWD, Meghalaya to publish the tender notices for Umiam-Jorabat Expressway Project. The advertisement was published in various national newspapers. Accordingly, the bills submitted by the respective national newspapers were forwarded to the PWD for necessary payments”, the Director said
According to the Director, the DIPR is a nodal agency which verifies and certifies the applied rates, sizes and date on which an advertisement is to be published as per the rates updated by all the national dailies and then forwarded to the concerned department for payment and therefore, it is not a fact as alleged that the bill submitted by Magnum amounting to Rs. 28 lakh was not released by the DIPR.
All local and national dailies accept the DAVP rates applicable to purely Central Government departments with a precondition that they have to be routed through their Head Office in Delhi as per the DAVP approved norms. The DIPR is not entitled to release any advertisement at the DAVP rate to any department whatsoever. Approved central government departments are entitled to low rate only if they are released through Information and Broadcasting Ministry (DAVP), Delhi, the Director said.
The advertisement rates fixed by the state government from time to time covers only local newspaper and not national newspapers as they do not fall under the purview of the state government advertising policy.
“It is not a fact that DIPR had approved Magnum for advertisement to be published in the National dailies rather it was Magnum who had requested for empanelment and advertisement to be released to them. There is no question of the rates to be negotiated. The rates are as per respective commercial rates of the national newspaper”, the Director said.
According to the director, no agreement was signed by the DIPR with any of the empanelled advertising agencies since the role of the DIPR is only to forward the advertisement of the various departments to the local or national newspapers for publication and subsequently forward the bills to the concerned department for payment of the same.
It may be mentioned that Magnum Intergrafiks filed a case against the Secretary, Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Director General, Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Chief Engineer, Central Division (PWD Roads), Meghalaya Government in the court of senior judge, Mangalore, for recovery of Rs. 26,85,786 along with interests from the Meghalaya Government for getting six advertisements published in national news papers."

“By pushing for passage of the modified bill the PDF has proved that it is pro-outsiders. By accepting the deletion of sub section 8 and 16 of section 5 they have proved that they are not concerned about protecting the interests of the indigenous people,” HYC president Peter Lawai told newsmen here on Monday.
He claimed that deletion of these two sections will further complicate the situation and drag the Rangbah Shnong into unwanted controversies.
“There are possibilities that the Rangbah Shnong might be pushed to the court if he denies a residential certificate to any non-tribal,” Lawai stated.
HYC general secretary Robert June Kharjahrin referred to the claims by the KHADC and the State Government that sub section 16 of Section 5 was in conflict with the Fundamental Rights, and reminded them that Article 19 of the Constitution states that both the State Government and District Council can come up with laws to protect the interest of its people and regulate the entry of outsiders.
He was of the opinion that the issue can only be resolved in a court of law and not by the State government or the district council.
Kharjahrin said the HYC would petition the Governor urging him to keep his assent in abeyance due to public resentment against the rectified bill.
He also urged the ruling coalition in the KHADC to take the responsibility to
ensure that the two deleted clauses should be immediately re-inserted in the VAB.
Pointing out that the rectified VAB was full of flaws, Lawai said, “We want to remind the KHADC that the VAB is not only for issuing certificates but should also be meant to protect and safeguard the rights and interest of the indigenous community.”
When asked about their strategy considering that the VAB is expected to get the Governor’s assent very soon, Kharjahrin said, “The organization will sit and decide on its future course of action on the matter.”"

SHILLONG: A scam is brewing with Directorate of Information and Public Relations (DIPR) involving in over Rs. 28 lakh faulty agreement with a Mangalore-based advertising company for advertising quarter page tender notices in six national newspapers to publicize the Umiam-Jorabat Expressway Project.
According to sources, Magnum Intergrafiks Private Limited based in Mangalore filed a case (money suit no. 176 of 2013) against the State Government in the court of senior judge, Mangalore, for recovery of Rs. 26,85,786 along with interests from the Meghalaya Government for getting six advertisements published in national news papers.
While four advertisements were published in December 2010, two others were published in 2011.
Magnum Intergrafiks Private Limited made both the Centre and the State parties to the case.
The company issued notices to the Secretary, Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Director General, Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and Chief Engineer, Central Division (PWD Roads), Meghalaya Government.
Sources said that DIPR had given work order to Magnum to get the tender notices advertised for which Magnum claimed money.
Though the bill to realize over Rs. 28 lakh was given to DIPR by Magnum sometime in 2011, the amount was not released.
The problem came to the fore after the Central government and the State maintained that the amount agreed by DIPR was too high as Magnum had quoted the market rate.
The prevailing rates of both the state and the centre are lower compared to the market rate, but, strangely the market rate quoted by the company was accepted by DIPR. Moreover, there was no written agreement between DIPR and Magnum before allotting the work order.
Following the complaints by Magnum, there were correspondences between NHAI, union ministry of road transport and highways, DIPR and state PWD.
Questions are doing the rounds as to why the DIPR approached Magnum for the advertisements to be published in national dailies whereas DIPR should have contacted the advertisement departments of the national dailies directly for publishing the tender notices.
While Magnum was entrusted with the task, the rate should have been negotiated, sources added.
With the state government engaging lawyer to fight the case, sources said that the view of DIPR was that though there was no agreement executed with Magnum, the company was empanelled with DIPR.
After the case was filed in 2013, the government lawyer appeared in April and beginning of June this year in Mangalore as part of the case."

West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Pravin Bakshi informed that inquest of the body has been completed and the order for the magisterial inquiry will be out on Monday.
According to Bakshi, Addl. District Magistrate Z.J. Sangma will head the magisterial probe.
The murder convict, Sovraj Sonar (32), died under mysterious circumstances after he was rushed to hospital late Friday night.
He was serving life sentence along with two others for the cold-blooded murder of a 9-year-old child.
What caused the convict to suddenly fall ill and throw up repeatedly before losing his life remains a mystery with jail authorities awaiting the  post-mortem report conducted on Saturday.
Sovraj Sonar along with kingpin Suroj Gupta and Ajoy Das were sentenced to death for the murder of nine-year-old Vaibabh Singh on August 24, 2007.
The trio, who happened to know the child, took him away in a car driven by Ajay Das after offering him an ice cream on a hot Sunday evening of July 26, 2006.
They strangulated the child and dumped his body at Chinabat area on the Tura-Williamnagar road before fleeing to Guwahati.

1386,"Despite HC order, action against shopkeepers unlikely","Monday, June 8, 2015","SHILLONG: The fact that the bylaws of Shillong Municipal Board do not have any provision for punitive action to be taken against shopkeepers who do not open their establishments will defeat the purpose of the May 27 High Court of Meghalaya order against them.
The High Court had ordered the State Government to take action against shopkeepers and owners of commercial vehicles for not operating during the HNLC-sponsored bandh on May 17.
However, in the absence of any punitive clause in Municipal bylaws to take action against shop owners who do not open their establishments, the State Government is in a dilemma.
Moreover, the explanations given by taxi owners, who had been issued with show cause notices, could also add to the government’s concerns as they have raised the issue of lack of security  on all the roads in the event of any untoward incident taking place.
A major impediment faced by MUDA is that while the medical shops come under the purview of drug inspectors and the Health department, wine stores fall under the jurisdiction of the Excise department.
MUDA cannot stretch its jurisdiction to infringe on the powers of agencies like Health and Excise departments, an official said.
Sources said that as many as 400 shop owners in the city have responded to the show cause notices issued by Meghalaya Urban Development Authority (MUDA) following the High Court order.
As far as vehicles are concerned, the last date for filing replies is on June 10. The Transport department has issued show causes to as many as 7000 commercial vehicle owners and 5000 local taxi owners."

“We have received the comments related to the matter from Meghalaya Raj Bhavan and we are examining it,” Shambu Singh, Joint Secretary in charge North East, Ministry of Home Affairs, said over phone on Sunday.
After the PIL in this regard came up in the High Court of Meghalaya, the then Governor K.K. Paul had sought comments from the Union Home Ministry on whether the MLAs can also function as MDCs as there is an element of office of profit due to the dual posts held by them.
During the May 28    hearing lawyer Pradeep Rai, Amicus Curiae (friend of the court) had sought a report from the Secretary to the Meghalaya Governor on the issue.
During the same hearing, State Advocate General K.S. Kynjing, appearing for the State, while arguing on the question of maintainability of the PIL on dual posts, had said that in terms of Rules 17 and 19 of the Assam and Meghalaya Autonomous District Councils Rules, 1951, the Meghalaya Governor is the final authority to decide the issue.
The PIL mentions about the rule 17(1) (a) of the Assam and Meghalaya Autonomous District (Constitution of District Councils) Rules 1951 for the disqualification of MDCs who are holding other posts (as legislators).
The rule 17 (1) (a) says, “A person shall be disqualified for being elected as, and for being, a member of the District Council if he is a salaried servant of the Government of India or the Government of any State specified in the first schedule to the Constitution or is an employee of any District Council or any Regional Council.”
During the next hearing on June 25, Raj Bhavan will file the affidavit regarding the matter, an official said.

1392,Village road hurdle to Umroi Airport expansion,"Monday, June 8, 2015","SHILLONG: Even as the State Government is pushing the Centre to speed up the work for improvement of the Shillong Airport, sources from the North Eastern Council (NEC) say  that a village road which passes through the heart of the airport is still the bone of contention in the project.
Sources informed that unless the issue related to the road is resolved, the expansion work of the airport cannot take off.
“The airport needs to be properly closed with boundary walls to avoid security breach,” sources said.
It may be mentioned that Transport Minister HDR Lyngdoh recently met Union Minister for Civil Aviation, Pusapati Ashok Gajapati Raju in New Delhi and pressed upon him the need to speed up the work to improve the existing airports in the Hill State.
The State Government plans to have a direct flight from Umroi to New Delhi and the Union minister said that work to expand the runway of Umroi Airport as well as fencing of the boundary would start at the earliest.
The State Government had acquired additional land of around 224.16 acres for expansion of Umroi Airport a few years ago and also took steps to construct a 20-feet wide road which would connect the villages adjoining Umroi Airport.
A major portion of the additional land has been handed over to the Airports Authority of India (AAI)."

1397,Murder convict dies under mysterious circumstances,"Sunday, June 7, 2015","Tura: A murder convict, spending a life term with two others for the cold blooded murder of a 9-year-old child in the Tura district jail, died under mysterious circumstances after he was rushed to hospital late Friday night.
According to police, 32-year-old Sovraj Sonar began to throw up uncontrollably sometime between 9 and 10 pm of Friday.
Jail authorities informed police of the incident and a police team took him to hospital.
The convict was admitted into Tura civil hospital shortly after midnight and medical sources reveal that the prisoner’s condition deteriorated fast.
He was declared dead at approximately 5 am of Saturday.
What caused the young convict to suddenly fall ill and throw up repeatedly before losing his life remains a mystery with jail authorities awaiting the post-mortem report conducted on Saturday.
Family sources of Sonar reveal that the young man kept himself fit inside the prison.   “When the patient was brought to the hospital he had already stopped throwing up. But his condition began to deteriorate and he passed away early morning” said a doctor from the hospital.
Having converted to Christianity he was given a proper burial on Saturday.
Meanwhile, in a first of its kind and a breakdown of the jail rules, prisoners, both under trial and convicts, were allowed by the prison authorities to allegedly come out of the jail and into the main road where the parked mortuary van containing the body was located to pay their last respects to their departed inmate.
“We were shocked to see prisoners, including murder accused, venture out of the red gate to see the body. Its a miracle that none of the prisoners took advantage to escape,” said one of the well wishers of Sonar’s family.
Sovraj Sonar along with kingpin Suroj Gupta and Ajoy Das were sentenced to death for the cold blooded murder of 9-year old Vaibabh Singh on August 24, 2007.
The trio, who happened to know the child, took him away in a car driven by Ajay Das after offering him an ice cream on a hot Sunday evening of July 26, 2006.
They strangulated the child and dumped his body at Chinabat area, on the Tura-Williamnagar road before fleeing to Guwahati.
From Guwahati they called up the family of the murdered child and demanded Rs 50 lakh as ransom for his safe return, keeping the murder a secret.
All three accused were arrested on their return to Tura and the body of the child was retrieved by police.
The additional district sessions judge of West Garo Hills, A. Ch. Marak pronounced the death penalty for all three accused on Aug 24 2007.
The judge in his verdict termed the murder “spine chilling and nerve shattering.”
In December, 2014, a fast track court commuted the death sentence into life imprisonment for Sonar and Suroj besides awarding 14-year of RI to Ajoy Das."

Lyngdoh made the remark in reference to DGP Rajiv Mehta’s appeal to the High Court to restrain media from publishing news related to bandhs called by proscribed organizations.
“Why blame only the media when each and every stakeholder is equally responsible to ensure that peace prevails in the State,” Lyngdoh questioned.
The former home minister added that the Chief Minister and Home Minister Roshan Warjri should have taken a step to get all stakeholders on board as part of the attempt to promote peace and security in the State.
“But sadly both have failed,” Lyngdoh, who was responsible for neutralizing the militant outfit HNLC, said.
“The fight against militancy is not one-dimensional but multi-dimensional,” he said.
The former home minister emphasized that the current political leadership should realize that without the involvement of all the stakeholders it is extremely difficult to resolve the issue of militancy and its off-shoot like bandh.
“The legislature is trying to dominate, so is the judiciary with the executive (bureaucracy) withdrawing itself into a shell,” Lyngdoh observed.
Lyngdoh concluded that all the three organs must work in tandem instead of holding a single stakeholder responsible."

1427,Pressure groups want two deleted sections included in modified VAB,"Saturday, June 6, 2015","SHILLONG: Three pressure groups – KSU, FKJGP and KWWADA – have reiterated that the State Government should incorporate the deleted sections in the modified KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2015.
“We feel that sub section 8 and 16 of Section 5 are very critical in order to protect the interest of the indigenous population. We feel that deletion of these sections would defeat the core objective of formulating this legislation by the KHADC,” KSU president Daniel Khyriem told newsmen here on Friday.
Under sub section 8 of section 5, the Village Administration Bill had authorized the headmen or traditional heads to issue certificates to only the non Khasis of India who have been residing within the village/locality for a period of not less than 14 years preceding the date of application.
The deleted sub section 16 of section 5 had empowered the Dorbar executive committee to prescribe the restrictions, terms and conditions of entry of a person other than a tribal native resident into the locality or village or Shnong.
The KSU chief mentioned that they were opposed to only two of the 23 modifications suggested by the State Government.
“Therefore, the government should be more flexible in accommodating our demands for incorporating these two sections in the modified bill,” he said.
Khyriem also made it clear that they did not want to comment on the stand taken by the Synjuk Ki Rangbah Shnong (Sor and Khapsor) to back the modified bill.
“We do not know what transpired during the deliberation among the members of the Synjuk,” he said, while endorsing the stand of the Synjuk to bring all 30 KHADC MDCs on board to have a consensus on the issue. “We also want that all 30 MDCs should have the same stand on the VAB,” the KSU president added."

1430,"Pala demands additional funds, manpower for SAGY success","Saturday, June 6, 2015","NEW DELHI: Lone Congress MP in the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana Committee, Vincent Pala on Friday demanded additional manpower and funds for the success of the unique scheme meant exclusively for the development of villages.
Speaking at the first meeting of the high profile committee, Pala said that there has been no clear cut commitment with respect to fund allocation for the scheme by the Centre.
The 22-member SAGY committee is headed by the Union Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister, Birender Singh as its chairperson.
“The funds that have been released so far are only for the Members of the Lok Sabha and not the Rajya Sabha,” he said adding that a meager amount of Rs. 50,000/- per MP for the purpose of social mobilization is not enough especially for states like Meghalaya considering the large area of the constituencies and the terrain.
“It is also not very clear if the Centre seeks any investment to be made by the State Government too for the SAGY. If so, a clear direction to that effect should be given by the Government of India, so that appropriate budgetary outlays can be made by the respective State Governments in future,” Pala said.
“Given the poor network connectivity in the North East in general and Meghalaya, in particular, we have experienced difficulties in uploading huge amounts of data in time. The Government of India should sanction additional manpower for implementing the SAGY at critical levels,” Pala further said.
“Considering that the SAGY is going to expand with every passing year, the current load of the state’s Rural Development Department itself being very high, unless additional manpower is created, it will be very difficult to cope with the load,” the former Union Minister said.
“Further, it has been indicated that every MLA of the state should also adopt a village in the line of the SAGY.  When that happens, that workload will increase manifold,” he added.
SAGY is a rural development programme broadly focusing upon the development in the villages which includes social development, cultural development and spread motivation among the people on social mobilization of the village community."

1436,Does M’laya have resources for upkeep of 18 Parl Secys?,"Friday, June 5, 2015","SHILLONG:  On June 1, the Kolkata High Court declared as unconstitutional a state law passed to appoint parliamentary secretaries to “aid and advise” state ministers. The Mamata Banerjee government in December 2012 passed the West Bengal Parliamentary Secretaries (Appointment, Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, empowering it to appoint parliamentary secretaries entitled to enjoy the status of a minister of state or deputy minister including pay and allowances.
The Act was challenged by Bikash Bhattacharya, a senior leader of the CPI(M) and a senior lawyer on the grounds that the West Bengal Legislative Assembly did not have the competence to enact such a law.
Bhattacharya argued that the Act was a fraud on the Constitution as it bypassed Article 164 (1) which states the total number of ministers in a state cannot exceed fifteen percent of the total number of MLAs. The bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur upheld the arguments and declared the act unconstitutional. With this verdict, the post of parliamentary secretaries has become void and all the appointments made under it now stand nullified. A similar petition is pending against AAP in Delhi as well
In Meghalaya there are 18 Parliamentary Secretaries enjoying the same status as Ministers of State.  They are allotted official vehicles, pilot car, escorts and are paid TA/DA as Minister of State are. This runs to hundreds of crores of rupees in a five year tenure. Speaking to The Shillong Times, a senior lawyer here said, “This defeats the very purpose of Article 164(1) as it is sort of backdoor ) appointment, similar to appointing Ministers by giving them a different designation.
Parliamentary Secretaries are supposed to assist ministers but most ministers here don’t have the quantum of work to require assistance from them. In fact, most ministers don’t share their work, leave alone their files which they guard zealously, a former Parliamentary Secretary confided to this reporter.
The senior lawyer said, “This is a fraud perpetrated by the Government on the society. If someone here challenges the appointment before the High Court, the Government would find itself on the back-foot.”
“Meghalaya is facing a resource crunch. Money for road repairs is not available in the PWD coffers, yet money can be spent where the Government wishes to, commented a retired government official.
In the past, some state parliamentary secretaries from Khasi and Jaintia Hills  had expressed displeasure over not getting any work whereas their counterparts from Garo Hills were allotted more works.
Among the 18 parliamentary secretaries, 11 are from Garo Hills.
The trend of appointing parliamentary secretaries began in the state after the downsizing of the ministry to 12 in Meghalaya in July, 2004. Prior to downsizing, the strength of the cabinet in the state ranged from 40 to 45 ministers."

The Deputy Commissioner (Supply) also asked all wholesalers and retailers to comply with the directive. The order comes into force with immediate effect.
The Deputy Commissioner Pravin Bakhsi said that the move was aimed at preventing people from the outskirts consuming Maggi.
“After Maggi products reach Tura, the same are sent to other districts and we thought if we stop the sale at Tura, this will serve the purpose,” the Deputy Commissioner said.       While the state does not have a food analyst since 2007, there is no drugs analyst either in the state for the last five years.
The Office of the Food and Drugs Testing Laboratories, Directorate of Health Services(Research) at Pasteur, Institute Shillong is the sole department for the whole state for testing the quality of  food and drugs.
However, in the absence of the analysts, the samples are sent to Guwahati.
The matter came to light after CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing went to the office of Food and Drugs Testing Laboratories here.  It was found that there were only assistant chemists and assistant analysts in the chemical section.
There is no method to test Monosodium Glutamate, and hence the percentage cannot be determined. The chemical department is currently testing only water.
Moreover, for the last five years, after the retirement of official V Khongwir who was a drugs analyst, the state government is yet to make fresh appointment.
The  state’s food safety office has already sent atleast nine samples collected from the Maggi depot at Mawblei in the city outskirts to the Guwahati-based Public Health Laboratory last week."
1438,Abducted engineer returns after 30 days,"Friday, June 5, 2015","TURA:  A junior engineer with the Border Areas Development Organization in Meghalaya has returned home after being released by his captors in Bangladesh early on Wednesday morning.
BADO engineer Aladdin M Sangma was in captivity for thirty long days after he was kidnapped at gunpoint from Dambuk Aga village on May 4th while travelling to Baghmara from remote Rongara along with his wife in his private vehicle.
Several attempts to rescue him proved to be futile since the kidnappers had taken him to Bangladesh .
Early Wednesday morning, the junior engineer was released at Badambari village of Indo-Bangla border, not far from Rongara at around 4 am.
Police sources revealed that it was the ASAK militant outfit which was involved in his kidnapping and the group is said to have a strong network across  the border.
The two ASAK militants who kidnapped him carried a carbine and a shot gun and forced him to cross the border into foreign soil.
Once inside Bangladesh, he was taken to a house in Gazipur village and kept confined under armed watch in a room for the rest of his days in captivity.
The house where he was lodged was frequented by armed Garos from the ASAK outfit who crossed over from India, it was revealed.
The network of the rebel group which had broken away from GNLA was not confined to Bangladesh alone. Members of the group are learnt to be operating in Tura town also and money to the tune of five lakh rupees was reportedly paid to the captors for his release.
The Rongara to Baghmara route has of late been a focal point for kidnappers and militant who abduct civilians and cross over to neighbouring country through the route to escape operations by police.
In March, an engineer of the Central government’s NBCC involved in installation of flood lights along the border was abducted from Rongara and taken across into Bangladesh. He was released only after the victim’s family paid the ransom money amounting to several lakhs, it is alleged."

1448,Arrest net widens over Ampati abductions,"Friday, June 5, 2015","‘Spotter’ in police custody
TURA:  South West Garo Hills police probing the string of kidnappings of Assam traders inside Meghalaya have widened their investigation with more arrests taking place on Thursday exposing the involvement of not just one but other gangs in the racket.
Five persons were on Thursday arrested for their nexus with one of the kidnappers’ gang in Ampati region as police continue an all out search operation to try and rescue a 12-year-old boy who was taken captive along with his 65-year-old grandfather on Saturday last.
The body of the grandfather was retrieved on Sunday from Damalgre road, near Tura, with a gunshot wound on his head.
Ampati police arrested Benedict M Sangma (22) of Upper Dobasipara village of Tura, Dicen Ch Sangma (30) of Apalgre village in Ampati, Nilejeng Ch Marak (25) of Apalgre village, Donobirth A Sangma alias Dono (20) and Nokmat M Marak alias Rohan (19) also of Dilnegre.
Benedict is said to be the leader of another kidnappers’ gang operating in the Ampati region. His gang had abducted Liril Hajong on April 21st and the victim got released only after a ransom was reportedly paid, police sources reveal.

1465,Dual post papers gathering dust,"Thursday, June 4, 2015","SHILLONG: The issue of some MLAs holding dual post is pending with the Union Home Ministry after the former Governor KK Paul had taken up the matter with the Centre.
During the hearing of the PIL in this regard on May 28, the High Court of Meghalaya has fixed the next date for hearing the matter on June 25 with lawyer  Pradeep Rai, Amicus Curiae seeking a report from the Secretary to  Meghalaya Governor on the issue pending for long.
However, an official with Raj Bhavan said on Wednesday that the Secretary to Governor will file an affidavit in this regard in the next hearing even as he said that the matter was earlier taken up with the Union Home Ministry.
On January 8 last year, the then Governor wrote to the Government seeking reply on the issue and subsequently, the state government sent its views to the Governor.
Later, the Governor took up the matter with the Union Home Ministry.
The role of the Governor on the issue of dual posts came to fore with the recent hearing of the case in the High Court of Meghalaya.
In the May 28 hearing,  the Advocate General KS Kynjing appearing for the state, while arguing on the question of maintainability of the PIL on dual posts , said  that in terms of Rules 17 and 19 of the Assam and Meghalaya Autonomous District Councils Rules, 1951, the Meghalaya Governor  is the final authority to decide the issue.
However, Pradeep Rai, Amicus Curiae informed the court that the matter of disqualification for holding dual posts/office through election and drawing separate salaries on both counts has remained pending for quite some time. “The representation was submitted way back on 18.07.2014 to the office of Governor, but it has, some-how, failed to engage the attention of the functionary”, he said, while suggesting to  issue notice to the Secretary to Meghalaya  Governor  for submitting status report in respect of the file.
However, as per records, the then Governor  KK Paul on January 8 last year in a letter addressed to the state government, while seeking a reply, said that the Constitution of India has reference to prohibition of simultaneous membership rules 1950 under which member of  Legislative Assembly, Members of Parliament  of both Houses are specifically mentioned .” While there are numerous other elected bodies , they are not mentioned by name, specifically,  but I think, the applied principle should be the same for all elected bodies unless a special dispensation is made”, the Governor said, while asking the Government to examine the matter in the context of elections to district councils.
According to Paul, a peculiar situation has come to his notice where he found that some of the elected members of Meghalaya legislative Assembly have simultaneously retained their elected seats in the Autonomous District Councils.
The then Governor had also told the Government  that the situation of MLAs occupying dual posts raises some vital legal as well as constitutional issues. “For instance, an MLA is attending the Autonomous District Council meeting where he is bound by the discipline and rules of that house. Does it amount to a breach of privilege of the Legislative Assembly? How can we justify a person holding   simultaneously two offices ( of profit)?, the then Governor asked."

The Minister said that there were instances of herds of wild elephants straying into the NEHU campus in Tura.
“We have already taken up with NEHU authorities on the need to create a permanent elephant corridor to avoid man-elephant conflict in the campus,” Tynsong said.

They claimed that the local residents of Mawlai were not benefitting from the BSF camp but were instead subjected to a feeling of insecurity.
The KSU delegation also stated that presence of ‘coercive forces’ within the campus of an educational institution was inappropriate.
“We were informed by the pro-vice chancellor that the BSF camp was set up in NEHU on the direction of the High Court following the disorder that had cropped up in the past in the form of rallies and public agitation,” the KSU units said.
The KSU NEHU Unit claimed that the Pro-Vice Chancellor had assured them that no permission would be granted in future for establishment of such camps within the NEHU campus.
The KSU also said that they had taken up the issue after witnessing the undisciplined and unruly attitude of the BSF personnel at the Convocation Ground/Hall of the University campus, including verbal abuses hurled on the students and the hostellers."

1502,Wearing seat belts an unknown trait in M’laya,"Wednesday, June 3, 2015","SHILLONG: Reckless driving on congested roads, disobedience of traffic rules and non-adherence to safety norms – all this and more have been contributing to the growing number of road accidents in Shillong and across other places in Meghalaya.
At a time when road accidents are on the rise in Shillong and its suburbs, it is evident that very few people in Shillong are accustomed to the habit of wearing seat belts while driving.
Safety norms make it compulsory for drivers and the front seat passenger to wear seat belts when a vehicle is moving. However, the ongoing trend in Shillong is than no one cares to wear the seat belts despite rules stipulating otherwise.
Be it private vehicle owners or local cabbies or Government-run buses, all drivers blatantly defy the law putting at risk their own safety as well as the safety of others.
Though road safety awareness programmes are regularly organized in Shillong, yet not much emphasis is laid on wearing seat belts. Given the number of road accidents in Shillong and the large number of fatalities recorded each year, large-scale awareness is necessary to educate the masses about the importance of seat belts.
It may be noted that in neighbouring Guwahati, the traffic police, recognizing the importance of seat belts, have made it compulsory for all drivers to wear seat belts and violations are dealt with in the form of hefty fines.
When contacted, traffic police officers in Shillong admitted that not wearing seat belt was a violation of the Motor Vehicle Act. They added that Shillong traffic police was making an effort to enforce people to wear seat belts."

1507,Pro-ILP groups tell Govt to speed up check on influx,"Tuesday, June 2, 2015","SHILLONG: Pro-ILP groups, which have been demanding for the implementation of a “comprehensive mechanism” to combat and regulate influx into Meghalaya, have urged the State Government to speed up the process.
“We want the State Government to speed up the process of implementing the mechanism suggested by us one year back,” KSU president Daniel Khyriem told reporters here on Monday.
On April 29, the groups had submitted their suggestions to the government on the need to implement a comprehensive mechanism to combat and regulate influx into the state in line with the  spirit of the Eastern Bengal Frontier Regulation Act, 1873.
However, the government has not been able to implement the proposed comprehensive mechanism, which includes setting up of exit and entry points in various parts of the State. FKJGP president Joe Marwein said that the Government should give top most priority to the setting of entry and exit points.
According to him, some districts have already completed the process of identifying the land for the purpose.
In Ri Bhoi, 15 acres of land for an entry point and 3 acres for an exit point at 19th Mile have been identified, he said  adding that the land identified at Malidor in East Jaintia Hills was given free of cost by the people.
According to him, the process to facilitate the setting up of this entry and exit points is now pending with the Director of Land Survey for releasing the land compensation.  “We therefore demand the State Government to direct the Director of Land Survey to clear the land compensation at the earliest,” Marwein said while informing that a delegation of pro-ILP groups would meet the Director on Tuesday in this connection.
Referring to the recent arrest of BNP leader, whose entry into Meghalaya is still a mystery, KSU general secretary Auguster Jyrwa said, “This has brought shame to the State Government which has failed to address the issue of influx coming from the neigbouring country.”"
1508,Tennydard moves Sonia for CM’s removal,"Tuesday, June 2, 2015","SHILLONG: In the wake of AICC President Sonia Gandhi asking Meghalaya government not to dilute customary laws in the context of delay in empowering headmen, social activist Tennydard M. Marak, who is pursing the ST status case of Meghalaya Chief minister, has petitioned the Congress president seeking his dismissal within seven days.
In a letter addressed to the Congress President, Tennydard on Monday said that  the Chief Minister of Meghalaya Mukul Sangma  has made desperate attempt to justify his  Scheduled Tribe Caste status by allegedly manipulating the truth and quoting  the controversial Garo Hills Autonomous District ( Codification of Garo Customary Laws) Bill, 2009  in his counter affidavit dated 13th August, 2014 filed in W.P. (C) No. 343/2014 ( Tennydard M. Marak – VS – Union of India & Ors.) before the  Supreme Court of India  and made an unsuccessful attempt in tabling the same in the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council.
Marak pointed out that the Chief Minister in his counter affidavit quoting the controversial bill had cited that “section 3 (iv) of draft of Garo Hill Autonomous District (Codification of Garo Customary Laws) Act -2009 specifically provides that a person  who is born of a non-Garo mother and a Garo father is recognized as a member of the Garo tribe provided he follows the Garo custom and traditions. In the present case, the father of  Mukul M. Sangma was a Garo and married Rousanara Begum, who was a Muslim by birth. She was subsequently adopted into the Manda clan. Hence, Mukul M. Sangma born out of a Garo father and a non-Garo mother, who was subsequently adopted by a Garo, was rightly recognized as a Garo tribal as per Garo customs and traditions.”
Marak, however,  urged the Congress president to replace the Chief Minister since he admitted in the counter affidavit  that his  mother “Rousanara Begum D/o. Late Amiruddin Ali Ahmed of Nagaon , Assam was a Muslim by birth and a non-Garo and in order to justify his scheduled Tribe (Garo) status  he  manipulated  the truth by advocating the controversial Anti-Peoples Bill,  the Garo Hills Autonomous District (Codification of Garo Customary Laws) Bill, 2009 and made subsequent unsuccessful attempt to dilute tribal customs, traditions and laws by  tabling the same in the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council on the 23rd July, 2014″.
Tennydard  said that the law is very specific about the claim of Scheduled Tribes through marriage and the guiding principle is that no person who was a not Scheduled Tribe by birth will be deemed to be a member of Scheduled Tribe merely because he or she  married a person belonging to a Scheduled Tribe.”
Marak also  said that the claim made by the Chief Minister  (in Para 13 of the affidavit) before the State Level Scrutiny Committee for Scheduled Tribes, Shillong in Enquiry proceeding No. 1 of 2014 dated 31/03/2014 reveals that his mother Rousanara Begum D/o. late Amiruddin Ali Ahmed (an Advocate practising in Nagaon District Court in Assam), had attained the status of tribal by assimilation, which is contrary to law and practices of the Garos and the  attempt of assimilating Rousanara Begum the mother of Mukul M. Sangma amounts to forced assimilation. “The  United Nations Declaration on the 13th September,2007  duly signed by India envisages that the Indigenous people shall have a right to live in freedom, peace and security and shall not be subject to forced assimilation and destruction of their culture”."

The whereabouts of the grandson remain untraced.
On Monday a joint co-ordination meeting was held between officials from Garo Hills and Assam at Monabari police outpost in South West Garo Hills bordering Mankachar in Assam.
The meeting was necessitated due to tension in the area after the body of 75-year-old Abdul Mannan was found at Damalgre, between Tura and Garobadha on Sunday morning.
Mannan was abducted along with his 12-year-old grandson when he went to check on a cashew plantation at Kumligaon village of Ampati, a day earlier.
His body was found at Damalgre with a gunshot wound to the head.
Tension ran high in the Mankachar area after Mannan’s body was brought by police to the village of Kulaghat in Assam for burial.
Villagers vented their anger on police by pelting stones and police had a trying time controlling the crowd.
With the abducted 12-year-old child remaining untraced and simmering tension continuing to engulf the area a joint coordination meet was necessitated.
Leading the joint coordination meeting was Meghalaya Additional DGP Y.C. Modi and present were district SPs   Aditya Goenka from Ampati and Mukesh Singh from Tura, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Pravin Bakshi and Additional DC P.K. Boro from South West Garo Hills.
From the Assam side, the SP of Mankachar, SDO (Civil) of Hatsingimari and other magistrates attended.
During the meeting both sides stressed on the need to beef up security on either side of the inter-state border and intensifying of police patrolling to check criminal activities.
Paying of compensation for the family of the murdered trader was also agreed upon from Meghalaya side and modalities would be worked out to hand over the ex gratia at the earliest.
Criminal gangs having access to sophisticated weapons have been terrorizing the inter-state border for quite some time. Besides the abduction of Mannan and his grandson, two other missing traders remain untraced since the last couple of weeks."
1513,"People’s voice clear, scrap Ordinance: KHADC chief","Tuesday, June 2, 2015","SHILLONG: KHADC CEM Pynshngain N Syiem on Monday asked the State Government to pay heed to the writing on the wall and respect the voice of the people who are against the Ordinance passed by the Government for empowering the traditional institutions and headmen.
“The ruling coalition in the KHADC (PDF) also subscribes to the feelings of the people. Therefore, our stand is very clear that we will not allow the ordinance to be tabled in the Assembly,” Syiem told newspersons on Monday, while pointing out that He said that the various political parties and NGOs were also opposing the ordinance.
To a query on whether this was a tussle between the Congress-led State Government and the Congress-led Executive Committee in the KHADC, Syiem said the question of tussle did not arise since they were backing the voice of the people.
To another question on the double standard exhibited by District Council Affairs Minister H.D.R. Lyngdoh for being part of the State Cabinet which passed the ordinance and at the same time attending the KHADC special session which opposed the ordinance, the KHADC CEM said it will be difficult on his part to comment anything on the matter.
He was quick to add that the best person to answer the question was the DCA minister himself.
When reminded that the Chief Minister was very much in favour of the ordinance, the KHADC chief said they will not allow the ordinance to be passed since it infringed into the jurisdiction of the Council.
“I must remind that even the AICC president Sonia Gandhi   had backed the KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2015. Therefore, the PDF is very clear that they are not going to compromise on this issue,” Syiem asserted.
Meanwhile, three pressure groups – Khasi Students’ Union, Federation of Khasi Jaintia and Garo People and the Khasi Women Welfare and Development Association – on Monday demanded scrapping of the Ordinance and incorporation of two important sections in the rectified KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2014.
“We will not accept the ordinance at any cost. We demand that the State Government should scrap the ordinance,” KSU president Daniel Khyriem told reporters after a meeting here on Monday.
The KSU president also stated that the ordinance, if passed, will supersede the Residential Bill proposed by the 13 pressure groups as part of the comprehensive mechanism to check influx, adding that the ordinance would also intrude on the powers of the traditional institutions and the district council.”
Demanding incorporation of important sections in the Village Administration Bill passed by the KHADC with regards to the issuance of permanent certificates and to check influx, Khyriem said the government should consider adding ‘sub section 8 and sub section 16 of section 5′ in the original bill before sending it to the Governor for his assent.
According to him, removal of these sections has killed the spirit of the VAB.
“Any outsiders who comes to reside in the state for two days can easily get a residential certificate which is not acceptable,” he said."

The NH-40 is susceptible to landslides which is a matter of grave concern for frequent travelers.
According to some people, there are several places along the road where water seeps in from the hillocks which were cut during road construction causing the mud to get wet, thereby increasing the chances of landslides. Some fear that landslides may occur again in those areas in case of heavy rainfall. Fatal landslides were reported along the route last year, blocking the national highway for a few days.
The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, which conducted a study on the problem of landslides along the Guwahati-Shillong highway, recommended flattening of hill slopes in the entire stretch of the expressway to avoid recurrence of landslides. The report of IIT Roorkee has been submitted to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) which is analyzing it.

The people especially in the  rural areas can hardly see any doctors in CHCs or PHCs and they rarely  get medicines from  CHCs and  PHCs, but the Governments has dumped  expired medicines worth Rs 4. 25 crore in plastic bags to the jungle”, the meeting of BJP said."
1545,M’laya seeks addl fund for road project,"Sunday, May 31, 2015","New Delhi: The Centre may step in to help Meghalaya for completing the World Bank-aided Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana Rural Roads Project (Phase II).
The project, which is supposed to be completed within this financial year, has not made desired progress due to lack of fund besides other reasons.
The Hill State, which is facing an uphill task in completing the vial project, has demanded Rs 250 core instead of a meager Rs 92 crore, which was granted earlier, to complete the project, Meghalaya PWD Minister S Dhar told The Shillong Times here on Saturday.
He had a meeting with the Union Minister for Rural Development Chaudhary Birendra Singh who assured him to look into the matter favourably.
“I have sought the Union Minister’s intervention,” Dhar said.
Meghalaya is faced with the daunting task of constructing 1625 kilometers of rural roads under the PMGSY Rural Roads Project (Phase II) mostly due to lack of fund.
Dhar said that the outlay of the project for the entire state has been fixed at 100 million dollars for 290 roads and 36 bridges with a total length of 1112.83 kms. “Work has been going on since 2012,” he said.
“The outlay for Meghalaya as earmarked by the Ministry during 2015-16 is only Rs 92 crore  of which Rs 40 crore has been released,” Dhar said adding that the balance amount of Rs 52 crore is grossly inadequate.
Main reason for delay in completion of such projects s due to the difficult terrain,  cost  escalation.  World Bank has funded Rs 1070 crore over a period of five years  to construct rural roads under PMGSY.
World Bank support for PMGSY began in 2004 with a $400 million Rural Roads Project (2004 -2012). Under the project more than 9,900km of rural roads have been constructed in selected districts of Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh."

1547,Apprehended extortionists not our members: GHSMC,"Sunday, May 31, 2015","TURA: A day after six members of the Garo Hills State Movement Committee (GHSMC) were arrested for allegedly being involved in extortion, the committee has claimed that none of the accused are its members.
The GHSMC said that Nikman Ch Marak and Augustine R Marak continue to be its chairman and general secretary respectively since the inception of the committee and the arrested persons, Rupalson T Sangma and Lambirth Ch Momin are neither the leaders nor members of the committee.
The West Garo Hills Police had on Friday arrested six persons including Sangma and Momin for serving demand notes to coal exporters from Dalu.
“The Garo Hills State Movement Committee never indulges in extortion and serving of demand notes to any businessmen. It does not allow using of pad and seal of the committee except by the chairman and the general secretary for official purposes as enshrined in our constitution,” GHSMC publicity secretary, Chevibirth K Marak said in a statement.
While strongly condemning the incident the committee warned of apprehending in future, perpetrators of such acts and handing them over to police."
1548,Police action condemned,"Sunday, May 31, 2015","SHILLONG: The police lathi-charge on protesters, mostly women, during the HYC-sponsored rally on Friday came under sharp criticism with several organizations condemning the act.
In a statement issued here on Saturday, the HNYF central body condemned the law enforcement agencies alleging that, “they broke all laws of a democratic country and human rights by resorting to lathi-charge against pedestrians and innocent people even in areas beyond the coverage of the imposed section 144 CrPC”.
Stating that the situation did not warrant a lathi-charge, the HNYF said that the act only proved the inefficacy of the officers on the field to control the crowd.
“This is an attempt to convert Meghalaya into a police state,” it added.
The TUR also condemned the “police excesses”.
“The crackdown was more a failure of police and administrative measures to ensure the peaceful completion  of the HYC protest rally,” the TUR said.
It also condemned alleged police highhandedness against women protesters and urged the women’s commission to take steps to instruct the state administration to take note of this.
Meanwhile, coming down heavily against the “unprovoked lathi-charge” by the Police after the public meeting at Laban Sports Club, the Meghalaya Peoples Human Rights Council (MPHRC) slammed the police action as “inhumane and undemocratic”.
Condemning and brushing aside the justification provided by the East Khasi Hills Superintendent of Police, M. Kharkrang that “the use of force was imperative to ensure the rule of law”, the MPHRC said that the statement is an  absurd attempt to divert the attention of the public in the name of maintaining law and order.
“Further Kharkrang has failed to justify the difference between the use of force and mild lathi-charge,” said MPHRC.
“Who ordered or authorized the lathi-charge? Did the situation warrant it?  Was the use of force urgently needed to ‘resolve the situation’? Wasn’t there any other alternative to safely accomplish the lawful objective? ” questioned MPHRC even as it said that the attack is an example of state terror that is routinely unleashed on the people in order to crush their resentment,” said Dino Dympep, chairman MPHRC.
He also asked Home Minister Roshan Warjri to “examine and determine the claim of Kharkrang on the use of mild lathi-charge” which had resulted in injuries to several people.
The Youth Voices for Human Rights Organisation (YVHRO) also condemned the incident."
1549,BJP to move Guv to apprise Centre of failing law and order situation in M’laya,"Sunday, May 31, 2015","SHILLONG: The State unit of the BJP has decided to approach the Meghalaya Governor V. Shanmughanathan to apprise the Centre about the “complete breakdown of law and order situation” in the State.
This decision was taken in an executive committee meeting of the party held on Saturday in which various resolutions were arrived at.
“The law and order situation in Meghalaya has not only deteriorated, but reached the worst possible state. Garo Hills, which has 24 constituencies, is in a pathetic state of affairs where killing, kidnapping, extortion and bomb blasts have become the order of the day,” the BJP said.
The meeting observed that people in the Garo Hills region are restless and living in traumatic state, especially after the grenade blast in Tura Bazaar on May 27 in broad daylight.
“What is more surprising and makes us suspicious is that the Government of the day is silent on the issue of law and order in Garo Hills,” the BJP said.
The party, hence, resolved to appraise the ground realities to the Central Government through the Meghalaya Governor to do the needful at the earliest so the people can live a secure and peaceful life in the region. The BJP alleged that the current spate of agitation in the city has not been handled well by the government.  “The people of the state are questioning the sincerity and the capacity of the Government to provide the solutions,” the BJP said.
Terming as illegal the distribution of rations to Ampati constituency represented by the Chief Minister where indefinite bandh called by a militant group is continuing for the last two months, the BJP said that it is an act of misuse of power.
“Unconstitutionally, rations like rice, dal, oil and other items are being distributed by the administration despite the fact that no emergency has been declared or natural calamity has taken place. This is tantamount to misuse of the public exchequer and proves that there is a collapse of law and order situation in the State,” the BJP said.GHADC extension
The BJP also slammed the state government for the “unconstitutional extension of the term of the GHADC beyond constitutional limit”. According to the BJP, the state government misled the people of Garo Hills that due to amendment of the sixth schedule, the Union Home Ministry asked the government not to conduct the GHADC elections. “It is now clear that the Union home ministry asked the state government to conduct the GHADC election. In this context, GHADC should be brought under the administrative rule till the election is conducted,” the BJP said.
Border dispute
The party observed that while the BJP-led government at the Centre was instrumental in solving the boundary dispute with Bangladesh, the state government is yet to solve the Assam-Meghalaya boundary dispute though the Congress-led government was in power in the state for several terms now.
The BJP resolved to urge both the state governments to solve the border dispute at the earliest.
The BJP also expressed concern over the delay in completion of the Umiam-Jorabat four lane project and the difficulties faced by passengers crossing the single lane Dawki bridge."

SHILLONG: The crucial meeting of the traditional heads, ‘Dorbar ka Bri u Hynniewtrep’ organized by  Synjuk Ki Rangbah Shnong, will discuss the Village Administration Bill and also the Ordinance related to headmen approved by the Governor at a public rally at Polo Grounds on Saturday.
East Khasi Hills Superintendent of Police, M. Kharkrang, on Friday said several rounds of meetings with headmen in the past and he hoped that the rally will be peaceful.
The district administration has granted permission to hold the rally and has declared dry day to avoid any disturbances.
People from Khasi- Jaintia Hills, and also from various localities in   the city are expected to take part in the rally.
Earlier, traditional heads of various localities had urged the residents to take part in the rally.
While the Traditional Bill is being debated, there were demands to re- draft the Village Administration  Bill not only from the pressure groups like TUR recently but also from the UDP when the party had convened a meeting of traditional heads in January this year.
The UDP leader Bindo Lanong had in that meeting said that the Bill needed to be re-drafted since there were serious anomalies in it.
While pointing out to the anomalies in the Bill, the UDP working president had stated that Clause 6 of the Bill, which speaks about the ceremony of ‘teh Rangbah’ wherein “the male members of a village are to be recognized by the Dorbar Shnong once they attain the age of 18, is an unnecessary inclusion”.
He had also opposed the clause which called for the need to have a village development council (VDC) which will function under the Dorbar Shnong for implementation of all the developmental schemes and programmes of the government.
The meeting had also constituted a five- member committee to be headed by Lanong as its convener, with S.D. Khongwir, chairman of Mawlai Town Dorbar, and other headmen as members.
Later in March this year, the Dorbar Ki Rangbah Shnong Ri Jaintia, a coordination body of headmen of Jaintia Hills, had called for wider consultation on the proposed Jaintia Autonomous District (Establishment of Elaka and Village and Election, Appointment, Powers, Functions and Jurisdiction of Dalloi/Sirdar and Waheh Shnong) Bill, 2015 or the headmen’s bill.

1562,"Cabinet okays eligibility tests for UP, LP teachers","Saturday, May 30, 2015","SHILLONG: The State Cabinet on Friday held a meeting to discuss and approve various proposals including, proposal to conduct Teachers Eligibility Test (TET) for Upper Primary and Lower Primary teachers, property tax reforms and constitution of Municipal Property Tax Board, among others.
After due deliberations on the proposal to conduct TET for UP and LP school teachers, it was decided that the Government will notify the process of recruitment as per norms and guidelines prescribed by NCTE and RTE Act, 2009 and approved the proposal of the Education department to conduct TET examination through an Empowered Committee headed by the Commissioner & Secretary, Education with DERT as the Secretary.
On composition of Meghalaya Municipal Property Tax Board, the Cabinet was apprised of the 13th Finance Commission’s recommendation of two types of grant  components, basic and performance-based. While all the states will have access to the basic grant out of the divisible pool for 2010-15, performance grant could be availed only by states which met nine stipulated conditions and one of the conditions is that the state governments must constitute state-level property tax board which would assist the municipalities to put in place an independent and transparent procedure for assessing property tax.
Since Meghalaya Municipal Act, 1973 had no provision for the same, amendment proposal for insertion of a new section enabling the State Government to constitute state-level property tax board was introduced and passed by the State Assembly and assented by the Governor in March, 2012.
As per sub-section 2 of section 67A-composition of State-level Property Tax Board, term of office, its functions, budget & accounts are to be prescribed and hence the Cabinet approved the Meghalaya Municipal Property Tax Board (Constitution, Function, Fund and Management) Rules, 2015 and decided to constitute the Board in due course of time.
The subject of Property Tax Reforms in local bodies under Meghalaya Municipal Act was also taken up during the meeting. The Act empowers the Municipal Board to levy and collect property tax from the owners of the urban real estate (land and building). However determination of property tax had been subjective and at the discretion of the assessment officials of municipalities leading to discontentment amongst the public and leakage of revenue and considering these, as well as to bring more transparency and clarity, property tax reforms has been mandatory under JNNURM, ADB-assisted NERCCDIP and 13th Finance Commission Award. As such second Municipal Valuation Committee for Shillong Municipal Board was constituted in 2011 to re-examine the existing property tax system and recommend measures to implement unit area-based complete self assessment with the help of GIS mapping to determine the categorization of localities into zones and fix unit area value for each zone and based on the committee report, the new system of property taxation is evolved. The main objective of the reform is to bring down the gap between revenue collection and expenditure of the municipal bodies and bring in transparency and efficiency in tax collection system with user friendly approach.
In this connection the Cabinet asked the department concerned to organize workshops to sensitize the stakeholders and facilitate online posting of views and suggestions.
The Cabinet also approved the proposal of the Programme Implementation Department to set up MPLADS Implementation Monitoring Cell for proper implementation of the scheme in the districts.
Appointment of non-bonded doctors to the post of Medical & Health Officers in the State, proposal for amendment of Meghalaya Shops & Establishments Registration Rules, proposal to add new clause in Meghalaya Service Conduct Rules in respect of elective posts in sports bodies, appointment of new Secretary to Meghalaya State Consumers Dispute Commission and appointment of lecturers in Shillong Polytechnic under 3(F) Rules were among the agenda taken up for discussion and approval by the Cabinet."

1586,"VAB: Demand for secret ballot, amendment to bill","Friday, May 29, 2015","SHILLONG: Maitshaphrang Movement convener Michael N Syiem on Thursday demanded that the Village Administration Bill, 2014 should have provision for election of the Rangbah Shnong or headmen through ‘secret ballot’.
“The present system where the headman is elected by raising hands defeats the very spirit of democracy,” Syiem said while talking to newsmen here.
He said that if the VAB failed to address the present deficiencies in the election process then it will pave way for the Rangbah Shnong to continue to misuse their powers once the law is implemented.
Pointing to the deficiency in Section 8 Clause 1, of the VAB, Syiem said the bill only speaks of nomination, election and confirmation of Rangbah Shnong.
“It does not clearly state whether the election of the Rangbah Shnong will be done by way of secret ballot. Unless, this clause is make clear, the problem will continue,” the MSM chief said.
He also claimed that people wanted to become Rangbah Shnong since the Central government was pouring thousand of crores for rural development in Meghalaya and the funds go from the Block to the headmen.
Syiem also stated that the High Court ruling came in view of the misuse of powers by the headmen in expelling residents from the locality. Time and again, the headmen have been found to be engaged in depriving the people of PDS, ration cards and others benefits.
He stated that in order to empower the people the State Government should make laws so that people can directly take part in the development activities through local self government.
TUR demands removal of deficiencies in VAB
Demanding deletion of Section 19 of the KHAD (Village Administration) Bill, 2014, Thma U Rangli Juki (TUR) on Thursday said the bill suffered from various deficiencies which required rectification before it becomes an Act.
“There are many deficiencies in the present bill. If the bill is passed in the present form then it will hamper the interest of the community,” TUR member Angela Rangad said.
While referring to Section 19, she said that the section talks about ’emergency’ empowering the district council to suspend and supersede the village Dorbar at any point of time.
“We feel that the KHADC might misuse this Section to serve its own interest. Absolute power should not be given to the district council since there are possibilities of misuse of power,” she said, adding, “Our concern is that in the context of Meghalaya, which is rich in mineral resources especially Uranium, the section 19 of the VAB can be used against the people.”
Rangad, however, appreciated the bill passed by the JHADC, and said, “In the JHADC (Village Administration Bill) there is no such clause like Section 19.”
She also appreciated the fact that the JHADC had empowered women in its bill.
“Sadly, the KHADC has not incorporated provision in the bill for empowerment of women,” she lamented.
Rangad questioned the reason behind omission of the Raid Mynsaw, located along the disputed inter-state border with Assam, from Appendix II of the Bill.
“Is this a ‘clerical error’ or a ‘mischievous design’ by the KHADC? How can they be so careless and yet demand that the bill should be as it is,” she said while warning that such error can cost the State dearly.
Stating that as many as 16 major amendments were required, she reiterated TUR’s demand for a rethink on the bill and to take the views of all stakeholders while drafting and framing such a bill."

1609,Crucial meet on Village Bill today,"Wednesday, May 27, 2015","SHILLONG: The crucial meeting between District Council Affairs Minister HDR Lyngdoh and the two CEMs (JHADC and KHADC) to discuss on the Village Administration Bills passed by the two Councils will be held on Wednesday.
Confirming this, Official sources on Tuesday said that the meeting will discuss all relevant papers pertaining to the Bills before taking a decision.
When contacted, KHADC CEM Pynshngaiñ N Syiem, who is presently camping in New Delhi, said that he would try his best to attend the meeting.
Meanwhile, expressing concern over the proposed Village Administration Bill not giving adequate importance to women empowerment, the prominent women’s organization, Ka Lympung Ki Sengkynthei, has called for corrective measures.
Moreover, DD Lapang-led committee, which was formed  to empower traditional institutions, has only one woman representative. This has irked the Lympung Ki Sengkynthei which prompted its president Theilin Phanbuh to seek more  women representation.
In a statement issued here on Tuesday, the  Lympung Ki Sengkynthei Shillong (Coordination body of the different local women’s organization) has taken exception to the fact that women empowerment is not highlighted in the Village Administration Bill. The women’s panel also said that there should be more women in the Lapang led committee which at present has only a member from Lympung Ki Sengkynthei to represent the women.
Lympung Ki Sengkynthei said that during the meeting held on May 20, the Government had assured that more women representatives will be included in the committee. The President has also highlighted  the absence of role of women and their participation  in the Village Administration Bill 2014.
Lympung felt that it is high time that women should be given due recognition in the Local Dorbar, which constitutes half of the population and should not be ignored in a democratic country since women in of this generation have come forward and contributed in various aspects either for social development or in time of emergency to lend their support to the Dorbar Shnong.
“In  this 21st century where all over the world, women’s participation is acknowledged and accepted,  we cannot give excuses that we have to abide by our customary law . If we want a healthy democratic structure, true justice, accountability and transparency at the local governance, then  there is no need to compromise on the issue of women’s participation at the local Institutions”, Phanbuh said
According to Phanbuh, women should have the right to attend Dorbar as members and responsible citizens. “They should have the right to know the function and activities of the Dorbar. Women can no longer be just a mere spectator. They should be welcomed with respect and actively involved in the all round development of the locality”, she said, adding that women’s  participation will be an asset to the local Institutions.
Lympung Ki Seng Kynthei recently conveyed a meeting with the Synjuk Ki Rangbah Shnong to discuss the Village Administration Bill where  Lympung extended support to  Synjuk Ki Rangbah Shnong and also assured  to work together for development and welfare of  people especially the poor and the downtrodden. The members have also expressed their support for the rally scheduled to be held on the May 30."
1610,Centre not in hurry: Union Minister,"Wednesday, May 27, 2015","DAE still studying uranium mining project in Meghalaya
SHILLONG: Union Minister of State in charge of Atomic Energy Department Jitendra Singh has said that the Centre is adopting a cautious approach while dealing the proposed uranium mining project in Meghalaya.
“Certain projects have to be carried forward with caution. The Centre is always cautious while moving ahead with projects relating to nuclear energy, atomic energy. They carry a lot of sensitivity along with them, a lot of security, a huge budget. It has to be thoroughly worked out,” Singh said.
Talking to newsmen here on Tuesday, the Union Minister said “The issue (uranium) has come up but the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) is still studying it because this requires a lot of planning and spade work”.
“Certainly the department is exploring new areas of uranium reserves. We already have Meghalaya in mind as one of the new areas for uranium mining,” Singh said.
“But among the new areas, it is not only Meghalaya but Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh where they see the possibility. But this takes time, it requires budget, research, and there are also security concerns whenever they undertake,” he said, adding, “We will follow it up and decide if we can push forward”.
Asked if the proposed uranium project in Meghalaya failed to materialize due to pressure from the state government, he said: “I don’t think the state government has been much involved in that, but in certain stages, the state government also has to be involved.”
“In fact, some of the states have the apprehension that if projects like these come up, there will be some hazards, which we are trying to brush aside. This is   happening in other states also like in Maharashtra. They have the apprehension that if a new project is launched, there will be cancer all around, which usually does not happen,” he added.
The Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) had pegged Kylleng Pyndengsohiong Mawthabah project in Meghalaya for Rs.1,100 crore. The ores are spread over a mountainous terrain in deposits varying from eight to 47 meters from the surface in and around Domiasiat, 135 km west from here.
The UCIL plans to produce 375,000 tonnes of uranium ore a year and process 1,500 tonnes of the mineral a day."

The notification would be issued on June 3, while June 10 will be the last date of filing nominations. Counting will be held on June 30, an EC statement said.
Polling will take place from 8am to 5pm.
The electoral rolls of these Assembly Constituencies have been revised with reference to January 1, 2015 as the qualifying date and have been finally published on January 5, 2015 in Meghalaya, the statement said.
Model Code of Conduct shall come into force with immediate effect in the district(s) in which the whole or any part of the Assembly Constituency going for bye-election is included. The Model Code of Conduct shall be applicable to all candidates, political parties, the State Governments and the Union Government in respect of the above district, the statement added.
It may be mentioned here Chokpot seat fell vacant following the death of Garo National Council (GNC) legislator Clifford Marak on February 28.
The wife of Late Marak, Kalpana Sangma has already expressed her willingness to contest from Chokpot seat after she was elected as the acting president of the party recently.
It was after the people of the constituency proposed her name that she decided to contest the by-election.
Interestingly, from Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar constituency, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa is likely to contest.
Jayalalithaa, who took over as chief minister for the fifth time last week, will have to contest election within six months to become a member of the legislative assembly.
AIADMK MLA from Radhakrishnan Nagar Constituency P Vetrivel had resigned recently amid speculation that Jayalalithaa may contest the bypoll from there. (With inputs from PTI)"
1612,NEC to be revamped for region’s growth,"Wednesday, May 27, 2015","SHILLONG: The Centre has reiterated its commitment towards development of the Northeastern region “even without the special category status.”
“We have the North Eastern Council (NEC) not because of the special category status. The NEC, which is a separate concept altogether, is being strengthened and is being made more active for the overall growth of the region,” DoNER Minister Jitendra Singh said here on Tuesday.
He also maintained that the Centrally-sponsored schemes would remain unaffected whether “we have the special status or not”.
When asked whether the Centre will reconsider its decision on special category status, Singh refused to say much except “it is not strictly within the purview of the DoNER Ministry”.
“This is a separate issue altogether. No doubt, some chief ministers of the region had put forward that suggestion, the government will take an appropriate call on the matter,” Singh said.
While stating that the Northeast is a prime concern for the Centre, Singh, said that a number of new initiatives had been taken up in the last  five-six months including a programme called the ‘DoNER at your doorstep’.
“From January-February onwards every month for a period of 5 or 6 days lasting up to one week, we have officials of the Ministry and if possible the ministers of Ministry of DoNER are camping in one of these days by rotation. They have already done this in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura, Mizoram and now Meghalaya’s turn is also due,” he said.
Adding that often it was stated that NE should be brought closer to mainland, he said that with this new initiative, they have tried to bring mainstream India closer to the region. “The message should go that for redressal of your grievance you need not travel each time to Delhi and instead Delhi can also come to your doorstep and therefore the name is DoNER at your Doorstep,” he said.
Singh also said, “In addition, every fortnight we will have in Northeast at least eight Union ministers camping and travelling to their states.
Umroi Airport: The DoNER Minister has assured that his ministry will try to remove all bottlenecks which have delayed proposed expansion of the Shillong Airport at Umroi.
He also said that Shillong deserves to have a good airport. “It is an irony it doesn’t have an airport of its own. We are going to do that,” Union DoNER Minister said.
“This also helps in bringing down the resent which also contributes to this kind of unrest and terrorism,” Union DoNER Minister said."

The Committee reiterated the Union government’s commitment of developing the North eastern region of the country during its meeting with senior officials of the State Government and the North Eastern Council held at the State Convention Centre here on Tuesday.
The Parliamentary Standing Committee was led by its Chairman P. Bhattacharya while the State Government was represented by Chief Secretary P.B.O. Warjri and the NEC by its Secretary, Ameising Luikham.
In a thorough discussion, the State Government apprised the Committee on the problems that Meghalaya faced due to the suspension of Central Government’s subsidies on all development projects.
The Chief Secretary said that all the North Eastern States, with the exception of Assam, does not have huge resources to sustain themselves so suspension of subsidy has extensively affected the States of the North East. He urged upon the Committee to appraise the Centre of this problem and find ways to address it.
The Chief Secretary also pointed out that the Ministry of DoNER does not have technical support for developmental schemes which he felt is the reason for the delay in allocation of funds. So he suggested that the Committee look into this matter so that funds can be expedited in a timely manner.
Warjri also said that the NEC was doing a very good job and therefore with sufficient manpower and authority, the Council could be made to play a more effective role in the development of the region.
The NEC Secretary said the Council has been involved in many big projects such as setting up of state-of-the-art infrastructures in North Eastern Police Academy, power projects, medical institutions and others. Stating that the role of the NEC was vast, he urged upon the Committee to consider enhancing fund allocation and also the strength of human resources. He also felt that by working in convergence with DoNER and the State Governments, the North East can be at par with the rest of India.
The Committee gave an assurance that it will consider these issues and apprise the Central Government of the problems being faced by the states of the North East in general and Meghalaya in particular.
The Committee also felt that suspension of subsidy should be reconsidered and resolve at the earliest.
On the issue of the role of the Ministry of DoNER, the Committee felt that the role of the Ministry needs to be re-evaluated. Moreover, the Committee felt the need to strengthen manpower and technical know-how in the Ministry so that the developmental front of the North East is not hampered.
The Committee called upon the officials of DoNER, NEC and the State Government to work in synergy so that the bottlenecks could be resolved.

The meeting was unanimous that the bill needed to be amended to ensure that it is inclusive, democratic, accountable and transparent, adding that the bill has to withstand not only the constitutional test but also other legal challenges that will emerge in the court of law.
The unanimous voice that emerged from the meeting was that there are many flaws and loopholes in the bill and that these need to be rectified at the earliest before it is pushed for being passed.
“There are many anomalies in the VAB 2014 and discussions around the bill are ongoing. Hence we need consultations on this bill to further strengthen it so that it fulfills its mandate of protecting and empowering the people,” TUR member Angela Rangad said after the meeting.
She also observed that the bill should not bring confusion and chaos in the functioning and processes of village administration and should not destroy people’s rights and freedom that they enjoy in the Dorbar Shnong today.
Rangad also said that TUR stands firm that the bill needs major rectifications and through consultations will prepare the VAB Amendment Bill and submit the same to the government.
Earlier, the three-hour-long meeting saw heated debates with participants airing their views and giving points and counter points on various sections of the bill and also on the critique raised by TUR.

Earlier, farmers had to give evidence of 50 per cent plus of crop damages to claim compensation and now this cut off have been reduced to 30 per cent. Is this not pro-farmer?” the Union Minister questioned while talking to newspersons here on Tuesday.
While claiming that the NDA Government has been able to improve the growth rate of the country, Singh said, “Under the leadership of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the country’s growth rate was 8.4% but when we came back after 10 years it had come down to around 4%.”
“Within one year we have raised it to 5.6% and we are now going to touch almost 7%,” he added.
Informing that the present government led by Narendra Modi had completed one year on Tuesday, he said that the prime minister had announced in his maiden speech that his government would be dedicated to the people of the country.
“It is with this commitment in mind that the prime minister has come up with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana which has the provision for anybody to open an account without any deposit. This is a noble initiative since to open a normal account one had to run from pillar to post. We have so far already successfully started about 15 crore accounts,” Singh said."

That the scholars in the offing in Garo Hills are no less than their counterparts in other parts of the country is brought home with one of the region’s top schools scoring a six. With just two short of a perfect ten, the laurels earned by these students add lustre to the region’s academic skyline.

“We were informed that the final decision on the bus service will be taken during Modi’s visit,” Bangladesh Government Joint Secretary Azharul Islam Khan told newsmen here before returning to Bangladesh on Monday.
Khan also said an agreement and a protocol had to be signed between the two countries before the services were introduced.
It may be mentioned that a 26-seater BRTC bus trial run between Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka to Guwahati began on May 22.
Throwing light on the bottlenecks, Khan revealed that the narrow roads especially the hills as well as the single-lane suspension bridge over the Umngot River at Dawki posed difficulties for the bus considering its size.
“The Centre has planned several transport corridors between India and Bangladesh through Dawki, including the construction of a two-lane bridge over Umngot in Dawki”, he added.
Meanwhile, he said that the condition of Shillong-Guwahati road was very good.
He also pointed that the absence of proper toilets and eateries for passengers was another major drawback.
“The immigration office on the Indian side is another concern since it is still functioning manually. The function at the immigration office needs to be upgraded,” Khan said.
“As of now, it took more than three hours to get a clearance from the immigration office. The reduction in the time in getting the clearance from the immigration office will also help to reduce the hours of the journey,” he added.
“The duration of the journey is nine to ten hours only from Dhaka to Guwahati via Shillong, but we have taken more than that. The minor problems will be worked out between officials of both the countries,” Khan assured."

Earlier during the hearing, both the State and the Centre wanted the ban on HNLC to continue.
Both the State Government and the Centre also made written submissions before the   Judge of the Registrar, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal Delhi High Court, New Delhi, AK Pathak.
The Supreme Court lawyer and the state government counsel Ranjan Mukherjee said on Sunday that as per the amended Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal Act, the duration of the ban is for five years from the earlier ban period of two years.

1646,SC gives MPDA respite to Champion,"Monday, May 25, 2015","SHILLONG: The Supreme Court has granted a major respite to GNLA leader Champion Sangma by setting aside the order of East Garo Hills District Magistrate, passed in 2013, to detain him under Meghalaya Preventive Detention Act (MPDA).
It was on January 29, 2013 that the East Garo Hills district administration had booked Champion under MPDA for three years prior to the Assembly elections fearing that he would be out on bail.
Later, both the Single and Division Benches of the High Court had upheld the order which prompted the lawyer of Champion Sujit Dey to file a special leave petition before the apex court.
After the petition was admitted, the Supreme Court had sought response from the government.
Dey said on Sunday that after state government submitted the affidavit, the Supreme Court, during the hearing held on Friday, set aside the detention order.
Dey said that the right to make representation before the Centre and the district magistrate was not made known to them by the detaining authority after Champion was detained under MPDA. Moreover, it was only an apprehension that Champion would avail bail if he was not detained under MPDA.
Earlier, the High Court of Meghalaya had set aside another order under MPDA against Champion passed by the West Garo Hills district administration on January, 30, 2013.
Dey said that with the setting aside of MPDA cases, Champion will have to face only regular cases.
The Supreme Court lawyer and Government Counsel Ranjan Mukherjee said on Sunday that the order under MPDA was set aside on the technical ground that there was no question of Champion getting bail since no bail application was moved.
The reason for the district administration to book Champion under MPDA was that he would come out on bail, which, however, was not found to be tenable as the arrested GNLA leader had other pending cases and moreover, no bail application was moved.
Champion, who was arrested on July 30, 2012 was booked in nine cases, four in Tura, two in Williamnagar, two in Nongstoin and one in Mendipathar."

According to the former Chief Minister, if there is no major deficiency in the two Bills then the Government can immediately approve them. “There is always a scope of bringing amendments to improve it at any point of time,” he added.
While supporting the decision of the Government to promulgate an ordinance on the issue, he said, “The Government cannot just close its eyes. It has brought this ordinance to provide an interim relief to the traditional institutions”.
“The ordinance can be dropped and changed anytime since it was adopted to bring the present situation under control. We do not want the headmen to become non-functional,” he said.
Informing about the present status of the ordinance, he said that it is still awaiting the approval of the Governor."

The HNLC had on Friday threatened to call 48-hour bandh starting from 6 pm of May 26 giving a deadline till Monday for the Government to solve the impasse over the Village Bill.
However, in a statement issued here on Sunday,  the under secretary to political department said that the government was committed to thwart the attempt of HNLC to disrupt normal life during the bandh."
1650,"Govt says no bandh, assures full security","Monday, May 25, 2015","‘Attempts being made to mislead public’
SHILLONG: Reacting strongly against the 48-hour bandh called by the outlawed HNLC from 6 pm on Tuesday, the Meghalaya Government on Sunday assured that necessary steps have been taken to ensure that government offices, educational institutions and banks function normally.
The Government also assured that all educational institutions will be provided with adequate security cover during the bandh.
“Elaborate security arrangements in cities and towns and along all highways have been made to ensure smooth flow of traffic during the bandh,” the Under Secretary to the State Government said in a statement on Sunday.
In an attempt to ensure normalcy during the 48-hour bandh, the Government has encouraged all private and public transport operators to ply their vehicles normally and has asked all commercial establishments to function normally while also informing that public transport will run normally.
The Under Secretary also decried attempts by vested interests to mislead the general public through mischievous interpretation to the genuine efforts made by the State Government to provide a legal mandate to the role and functions of the traditional institutions, and also in the matter of the two Bills on Village Administration submitted by the two Autonomous District Councils for the assent of the Governor.
“The Government takes this opportunity to inform all citizens that the growing demand for institutionalization of traditional bodies, keeping in view the needs of the changing times, has engaged the priority attention of the State Government. There appears to be a broad public consensus in the State that these traditional bodies need to be empowered and institutionalized through appropriate legislation by the Government in order to facilitate their functioning in a responsible, accountable and cohesive manner,” informed the Under Secretary.
The Under Secretary also reiterated that the importance of Durbar Shnong and headmen (by whichever name known across the States) as an institution has been recognized all along by the Government, and these have always been closely associated with the welfare and developmental programmes of the Government as well as in the day-to-day administration at the local levels adding that there is an obvious and urgent need to institutionalize the role and functions of these time-tested bodies in order to avoid any confusion and also to address the vacuum caused by the recent judicial interventions.
The Under Secretary also expressed that the State Government was very much alive to the issue and was aware of various demands made from various quarters, which include the assent to the two Bills passed by the KHADC and the JHADC relating to   Village Administration.
“However, this needs to be clarified that it is the constitutional duty of the State Government to scrutinize and examine all Bills passed by the Autonomous District Councils before these are recommended to the Governor for assent, in order to ensure that these are in accordance with the Constitutional scheme of things and there are no conflicts with the statutes legislated by the Parliament or the State Legislative Assembly,” the Under Secretary said.
In the instant case, the Under Secretary said that it was found that the Bills passed by two Autonomous District Councils had provisions which appeared, prima facie, to be in relation to subjects that fall within the domain of the Central or the State legislatures.
“The Government has, therefore, convened a meeting of the CEMs of the KHADC and the JHADC, along with the legal experts, on May 27 in order to discuss these issues and ensure that the Bills are in conformity with the Constitutional scheme. The State Government expects that both the Autonomous District Councils will take further steps to recast the Bills appropriately,” the Under Secretary said.
Recognizing that the committee will take some time to come up with a final recommendation while there is an urgent need to address the vacuum caused by the recent judicial intervention, the Under Secretary stated that the Government, after consultation with several legal experts, seeks to promulgate an ordinance, namely, the Meghalaya Local Administration (Empowerment of Traditional Institutions, Traditional Bodies, Headmen in Governance and Public Delivery System) Ordinance, 2015.
“The Ordinance seeks to empower the traditional bodies to issue certain kinds of certificates that are required by the residents of the locality for various purposes such as the residence certificate or to be associated with the welfare and developmental programmes or in the delivery of public services as may be notified by the Government from time to time,” the Government said.
While maintaining that the judgment and order of the High Court should be respected, the Under Secretary states that the law provides recourse to address any grievances occasioned by such judgment and order.
“Given the steps already taken by the Government to address this issue, it would be more reasonable for all stakeholders to come and join hands with the Government in its effort to arrive at a rational, fair and sustainable solution to the problem,” the Under Secretary said."

Mark W. Kharkongor, Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant State Sanitation Cell, PHE, Meghalaya, who is a pioneer facilitator of this practice, stressed on the fact that there is nothing that can be called a ‘waste’ anymore in today’s world as long as people make use of the same.

1701,State’s 1st fish brood bank at Umktieh,"Friday, May 22, 2015","Mawpun: Meghalaya Fisheries Department has created history by turning a 4.7 acre swamp at Umktieh, Ri Bhoi District into a fish brood bank which will provide the best brood stock to fish farmers and hatchery owners in Meghalaya.
The swamp land was purchased from the MeSEB in 1979 at a princely sum of Rs 14,000 but was lying unutilised because the Fisheries Department did not have enough financial resources to develop  the place. It was only after the big launch of the Aquaculture Mission in 2011 that Fisheries Department could make progress.
About 200 fish farmers from different parts of the State witnessed this eventful march of the Fisheries Department towards self sufficiency in fingerlings. Principal Secretary Fisheries Department, KN Kumar said the low quality of fingerlings as brood stock quickly declined because the production could not be enhanced. “There is urgency for a brood bank to spawn fresh water fish in the region. It took us the Fisheries Dept four years to turn the bog into a brood bank and the credit goes to engineer Lucas Kharkongor who undertook a near impossible task of creating structures in the swamp,” Kumar said.
He informed that this is the first brood bank in the country except for the Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture at Bhubaneshwar. Meghalaya has partnered with Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA) at Kochi whose Chairperson  Leena Nair was present for the inauguration. MPEDA will supply the best brood stock which could in turn produce millions of fingerlings of Rohu, Katla, Mrigal etc. But Meghalaya will be trying to breed and acclimatise Scampi and Tilapia both of which are high value fish needing brackish water.  Kumar said that what the big break for Meghalaya fish farmers would happen when fish species diversification happens and exports take off. “The Department is ready and able to start this venture,” Kumar added.
Addressing the audience, Leena Nair said that the Fisheries Department’s ambition of producing 15,000 MT of brood in 5 years is daunting but not impossible. Pointing at the need to develop aquaculture, Ms Nair said that catch from the sea has reached a plateau due to over exploitation.  In 2013-14 India’s exports reached 1 million tonnes with Scampi being the major export. India is second only to China in marine product exports because 98% of fish is consumed domestic ally.
Nair said that in the past people has bad experience of rearing Tilapia but now the varieties have improved and can grow up to 600 grams in 5 months. She explained that Meghalaya had 133 varieties of ornamental fish which is sold to agents from Kolkata. “Ornamental fish are a national heritage and they need to be bred  so as not to lose this heritage.
Chief Secretary PBO Warjri said it is heartening to learn that MPEDA would provide guidance in use of new technology to promote fisheries. “We have been depending on Assam for fingerlings. Now we can rear our own brood to feed the upcoming hatcheries in the State.
Later the VIPs released fingerlings in the brood bank and also at the research station at Mawpun. The 200 odd fish farmers and invitees had to wait for over 2 hours for the Chief Guest to arrive – a scene that has become commonplace in  Meghalaya. Then there was a long line of security personnel posted all along the Shillong- Umiam road all the way to the Fish Brood Bank. The fish farmers and visitors wondered at the presence of so many security personnel.  Many of the fish farmers wanted to get more information about the brood bank and how they can access it but there was no information desk at the venue."

The AAYF besides launching a non- cooperation movement on May 19 and 20, also sponsored  night road blockade during these days to be continued till May 21.
In a statement issued to the media, GNLA  joint publicity secretary  GaroMandei Ch Marak  said on Monday that since the bandh was called for the good of Garo Hills and its people, the militant outfit extended its support.
“Since the Central government had already conveyed that it was the state government which is intentionally delaying elections for its interests, it is apparent that the success of the bandh would clearly jeopardize the political career of the  Chief Minister”, GNLA alleged .
According to GNLA, by looking and analyzing the motives and causes of the bandh, the GNLA is volunteering itself to stand behind AAYF and other supporting NGOs.
While asking the people to observe the bandh, the GNLA warned  the District Commissioners and the Government  servants not to go against the interest of the people of Garo Hills
Meanwhile, the West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner, Pravin Bakshi has imposed section 144 CrPc in the district in view of the non cooperation movement (NCM) and the night road blockade called by AAYF.
As per the section, prohibition has been put in place against the assembly of 5 or more persons in public places, causing obstruction to the movement of people and vehicles on roads as well as the carrying/concealing of lathis, sticks, stones, missiles, firearms or any kind of lethal weapons by any person, or group of persons or organizations."
1758,Withdrawal of ILP cases morale blaster for police,"Tuesday, May 19, 2015","SHILLONG: The hurry in which the state government withdrew as many as 92 cases filed against the leaders of several pressure groups under Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO) Act for damage to property of individuals and the Government, arsons and assaults resulting in injuries among others during pro-ILP movement of 2013 has, reportedly, demoralized the state police and the respective district administration.
The state government was under pressure to withdraw the cases fearing law and order problems in city.
It was following large scale violence at the end of 2013, that the Government had instituted the Special Court to deal with both criminal and civil damage suit.
While the police promptly registered as many as 129 criminal cases against the sponsors of ILP related agitations in 2013 under Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO) Act, 92 cases were charge sheeted on a fast track mode in 2014. Simultaneously, the Court also followed up the damage suit.
However, the Government has already decided to withdraw all the 92 criminal cases related to arson and other forms of attack, which according to sources, will dilute the role of Special Court.
An official said that though it was out of compulsion that the cases were withdrawn by the Government, it is now up to the Special Court to examine the plea of the Government to withdraw the cases.
The official, however, said that three murder cases and over Rs 31 crore damage suit will be followed up by the Government.
When contacted, a senior police official refused to comment to a question on whether police are demoralized following the withdrawal of 92 cases. The police had taken enough time and energy to build up the cases leading to the charge-sheet.
The stand of the Government has also resulted in preventing the public in filing any case in future against those who indulge in violence as they foresee that the Government of the day will ultimately succumb to the pressure resulting in withdrawing the cases.
When asked, the deputy commissioner of a particular district said that he is yet to analyze the implication of Government decision to withdraw the cases and also on whether the situation will lead to any precedence in future."

“At the moment he is sick. I will try to take him to a third country for better treatment”, Hasina told waiting media persons outside the separate building at Civil Hospital meant for under trial prisoners where Ahmed is lodged.

Salahuddin, however, maintained that he was kidnapped from Bangladesh and shifted in different vehicles from one place to another, finally landing up in Meghalaya."
1760,Brainstorm on building entrepreneurship the German way,"Tuesday, May 19, 2015","Shillong: A one-day brainstorming session was organized by Asian Confluence at the Aurobindo Institute of Indian Culture (AIIC) here on Monday. Making a presentation to a hall overflowing with young entrepreneurs, students and teachers the German Consul-General, Rainer Schmiedchen who arrived in Shillong on Sunday for a 3-day visit said, India and Germany have excellent relations and the Berlin airport is still decorated with ‘Make in India’ buntings from the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Germany for the industrial fair at Hanover some weeks ago.
Inaugurating the one-day session, Mr Schmiedchen said a 10-member steel delegation from Kolkata has just got their visa to visit Germany which has expertise in mining and metallurgy. Stressing on the need for vocational training at the level of school, college and university, the Consul-general said in Germany industry invests in providing apprenticeships for students who are then absorbed by the company. “Germany’s economic miracle is due to the Double Education System which is a twinning between theory (30%) with practice (70%). The blue collared worker in Germany is a proud person who can afford a home, two cars and two children and live as good a life as the white collared person,”Schmiedchen said, adding that India might need to emulate this model to bridge its huge youth unemployment gap and turn its demographic dividend into an asset.
Citing the example of roof making  as an activity requiring expertise, Scmiedchen said in Kolkata people have flat concrete roofs that tended to leak and turn the house damp. German technologists have perfected the art of making roofs that would not allow moisture to soak in. He spoke of farmers who are Milk Technologists and said in Germany industry works closely with universities so that theoretical and practical knowledge are well integrated.
Mr MP Bezbaruah, Member North Eastern Council rued the fact that the North Eastern states export raw materials and have allowed value addition to happen outside. He pointed to the large imports of meat and vegetables from outside the region and lamented that Tourism- a journey of imagination is yet to take off in the region.
Prof Ashoke Kumar Dutta, founding director of IIM Shillong who is currently working closely with Asian Confluence (AC) while highlighting the activities of the organization said that the objective of AC was to create a bridge of understanding and cooperation between the North Eastern region and South and South East Asia. “We need to source excellence to break the cycle of poverty which entraps us. We have to get investments in clean industries and create a congenial climate for that to happen,”Prof Dutta said.
Meghalaya Chief Secretary, PBO Warjri endorsed the need to give dignity to all kinds of manual labour. He said that during his recent visit to Germany for the Hanover Industrial fair he noticed that while Asians exhibited products, western countries exhibited technology and machinery. The West still has a good hold on technology development and inventions. “Innovation is what we need but it should be innovation of value and credibility, not a sub-standard technology,” Warjri said adding that India has to stop the brain drain and create a climate where innovations can happen. He lauded the Germans for being proud of whatever work they did. “A family friend proudly acclaimed that her father used to lay pipes and he did that with excellence,” Warjri told the audience.
A presentation by the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce on the German Dual System of Education was made by Sabina Pandey who explained that the availability of skilled labour had kept the unemployment rate in Germany at 7% which is the lowest in the European Union. There are at present several Indi-German training centres in India but the Double Education System providing a course on Mecatronics is being tried out at Don Bosco Pune, Pandey informed.
Explaining the importance of Vocational Education Pandey said this type of education (a) provides personal and social skills (b) it enables students to understand machines and work processes (c) it helps in problem solving strategies and abstracts ideas leading to logical thought processes.
Currently there are over 1000 German companies in India in automobiles, chemicals and electro-technology. This cooperation needs to be strengthened, Pandey who comes from Bavaria in North East Germany stated.
Later a workshop involving entrepreneurs and a question answer session to thrash out the way forward  was organized at the AIIC.
Tourism sector: Meanwhile, Consul General of Federal Republic of Germany  Rainer Schmiedchen has said that the  tourism sector in Meghalaya should have better infrastructure.
Later speaking to media persons,   he also said that the state should have a better airport and more private airline companies should operate in the region to connect it with mainland.
Reacting to a query on women entrepreneurs, he said that Germany has been organizing special programmes for women and they want atleast 50 percent of women  in every company."

“In the past, I used to receive memorandums for development of roads and construction of school buildings. However, the mindset of the people is changing. People are now asking for mobile towers instead of developmental schemes,” Sangma said while speaking at an event organised to present the Sanchar Seva Padak Award 2015 here on Monday.

“I may not be able to come back as MP in the next election if I cannot fulfill these pending demands for installation of mobile towers of the people. Only BSNL can help the people by providing them with mobile towers so that I can be re-elected as an MP,” he said on a lighter note.
“Connectivity is important especially in a region like the Northeast,” Sangma added.
“A region like the Northeast which shares borders with foreign countries needs to be looked at differently when it comes to connectivity,” he said.
The MP pointed out that due to problems of connectivity, people of the State living along international borders are using Bangladesh mobile network. He, however, congratulated the government for its efforts towards improving connectivity in the NE region and said, “The government and the BSNL have sanctioned up to Rs 5300 crores for expanding the network connectivity in the region.” Earlier, around 26 employees of the BSNL were honoured on the occasion."

Earlier, the City Police had issued an advisory asking people to remain cautious against a criminal gang which usually throws some irritants or dirt to distract the victim before looting him/her.
Usually one member of the gang applies the dirt while the other tells the target that some substance was stuck in his/her clothes. As the victim gets busy rubbing off the dirt from the clothes, the gang members snatch their purse/bag etc. and flee from the spot.
Dropping of money on the road is another method adopted by the miscreants to rob their prey.

1772,Salahuddin’s early extradition unlikely,"Monday, May 18, 2015","Wife of Bangla politico to arrive in Shillong today
SHILLONG: Extradition of Bangladeshi politician Salahuddin Ahmed, who is now in police custody in Meghalaya, is unlikely due to multiple reasons including his illegal entry into India and ongoing medical treatment.
While the Meghalaya police wanted to complete the legal process of producing the arrested Bangladeshi politician before the Court at the earliest as they have to concentrate in local law and order issues, several tests are yet to be completed in Civil Hospital before Ahmed is finally discharged.
Though there are press reports that Ahmed will be extradited soon, BSF, which is the nodal agency to hand over any arrested Bangladeshi intruder to its counterpart BGB, said on Sunday that they are yet to receive any information on extradition of Ahmed.
Ahmed was admitted to Shillong Civil Hospital on May 12, a day after he was lodged at Meghalaya Institute of Mental Health And Neurological Sciences (MIMHANS) after his arrest on May 11 under Foreigners Act for travelling without valid documents.
A senior lawyer well versed with cases related to violation of Foreigners Act said that after the police produces the Bangladeshi national before the Court, he will be placed under judicial custody which means that he will be lodged in jail.
The maximum punishment for illegal entry is imprisonment for five years.
“In the meantime, if the Government makes an appeal before the Court for his extradition, the   matter will be examined by the Court”, the lawyer said
Meghalaya DGP Rajiv Mehta when contacted said that the Bangladeshi national will be produced before the Court by the police only once he is discharged from the hospital.
“We feel the quicker he is released, it is better for us since the Meghalaya police have other law and order duties both in Shillong and Garo Hills to be attended to”, Mehta said.
The police chief said that it was up to the Court to give its judgment regarding the violation of Foreigners Act or about his extradition.
“As of now, we will have to produce him before the Court and if there is any direction from the Government of India, we will bring it before the Court”, Mehta said.
As far as the demand for treatment in Singapore is concerned, this can happen only after he lands up in Bangladesh, the police chief said.
While stating that no direction has come from any quarters on the extradition of arrested Bangladeshi national, the BSF DIG SK Singh said that once a decision on extradition is made, the matter will be communicated to Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) and subsequently he will be handed over to them in the border.
Meanwhile, Dr  D. J Goswami of Civil Hospital, who is treating Ahmed said on Sunday that while the ECG test carried out to assess his heart condition is normal, the use of ultra sound to check the condition of kidney was not satisfactory which prompted the doctor to go for CT scan. “A surgeon has to give his opinion on his kidney ailment after the CT scan is conducted”, Dr Goswami said. Besides, a skin specialist has also been deputed to examine whether there are any complications in the skin.
“We have to sit together to compile the health status report of the patient before he is discharged”, the doctor said.
However, as per preliminary reports, Ahmed is responding to the treatment and the condition is more or less normal, the doctor said, adding that the patient is also taking food provided by the hospital.
Though the BNP leader Jony Abdul Latif who met Ahmed at Civil Hospital on Sunday claimed that the latter is suffering from memory loss, the doctor said that he was speaking normally and spontaneously.
In another development, Hasina Ahmed, the wife of arrested Bangladeshi politician Salahuddin Ahmed will arrive here on Monday to meet her ailing husband at Shillong Civil Hospital, sources said.
According to sources, Hasina has already boarded a flight and will stay at Kolkata on Sunday night."
1773,ST status case: Tennydard seeks closure of state-level probe,"Monday, May 18, 2015","SHILLONG:  Political activist Tennydard Marak, who has challenged the ST status of Chief Minister Mukul Sangma, filed an interlocutory application on May 15 in Supreme Court stating that there should not be any room for further inquiry into the ST status case by the State Level Scrutiny Committee as the Chief Minister himself had admitted in his affidavit that her mother was a non-Garo.
Marak also wanted the Court to declare that the respondents, the Chief Minister and his brother and Cabinet Minister Zenith Sangma are not eligible to continue as MLAs.
Marak alleged that the Chief Minister in his counter affidavit dated 13thAugust, 2014 filed  before the Supreme Court of India in order to justify his Scheduled Tribe Caste status even cited the controversial  Garo Hills Autonomous District ( Codification of Garo Customary   Laws) Bill, 2009 and made an unsuccessful attempt in tabling the same in the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council on July  23 , 2014 which is apparent from the  counter affidavit of August 13 which said that ” Section 3 (iv) of draft of Garo Hill Autonomous District (Codification of Garo Customary Laws) Act -2009 specifically provides that a person who is born of a non-Garo mother and a Garo father is recognized as a member of the Garo tribe provided he follows the Garo custom and traditions. In the present case, the father of Mukul M Sangma was a Garo who married Rousanara Begum, who was a Muslim by birth. She was subsequently adopted into the “Manda” clan. Hence,  Mukul M. Sangma born out of a Garo father and a non-Garo mother, who was subsequently adopted by a Garo, was rightly recognized as a Garo tribal as per Garo customs and traditions.”
While referring to the submission made before the State Level Scrutiny Committee for Scheduled Tribes, Shillong  by the Chief Minister that his mother Rousanara Begum daughter of  late Amiruddin Ali Ahmed (an Advocate practicing in Nagaon District Court in Assam), had attained the status of tribal by assimilation, the petitioner said that this is contrary to law and practices of the Garos.
“The attempt of assimilating Rousanara Begum, the mother of Mukul M. Sangma amounts to forced assimilation and the United Nations Declaration on the 13thSeptember,2007 is very specific and duly signed by India envisages the need to respect and promote the inherent rights of the Indigenous people which derive from their political , economic and social structures and from their cultures , spiritual traditions , histories and philosophies especially their right to land, territories and resources. For that, the Indigenous people shall have a right to live in freedom, peace and security and shall not be subject to forced assimilation and destruction of their culture”, Marak  asserted ."

The All Achik Youth Federation (AAYF) had threatened to launch a series of agitations which will begin with a poster campaign on May 18 followed by a non-cooperation movement on May 19 and 20.
The AAYF also sponsors the night road blockade during these days which will continue till May 21. “The district administration will invoke provisions and penal sections of the Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (Amendment) Act, 2013 to deal with any threat, intimidation or forced closure as well as loss to economy and business,” West Garo Hills district Deputy Commissioner Pravin Bakshi said on Sunday.
Since security have been beefed   up to thwart any attempt to disrupt peace, he said, instructions have been issued to the state and central government institutions to remain open and functional. “All officers and staff shall also report for duty and it will be observed that all banks and post offices are opened and fully functional for the service of the people,” he said.
The AAYF’s earlier ultimatum which ended May15 demanded the state government to dissolve the present executive committee as well as to fix the date for election to the GHADC which has been extended thrice since last year in the hope to accommodate surrendered militants.
GHSMC extends support: Meanwhile, the Garo Hills State Movement Committee (GHSMC) has extended its support to the AAYF’s agitational prorgammes.

TUR, after studying the draft Village Administration Bill 2011 and the Bill passed by KHADC in 2014, said that the provisions of the law from its Draft to the Bill as passed, have only further diluted in favour of undemocratic and autocratic provisions. “The language of the Bill is exclusionary and patriarchal and hence unacceptable. By using masculine terms, the Bill exposes the strong gender biases and discrimination held by the representatives,” the TUR said.According to the pressure group, the crucial clauses of the Bill have been designed to usurp powers that are conventionally vested with the Dorbar Shnong or the people by centralising authority with the Rangbah Shnong and the Executive Committee of the District Council – offices that are themselves non transparent and unaccountable and require urgent reforms.    The Bill has no intention to fulfill the constitutional guarantee of equality in a democracy, and election is a necessary condition to be fulfilled and not an option, but by legally sanctioning nomination as a valid method of choosing the Rangbah Shnong through Section 8 (1), the Bill makes the Dorbar Shnong as a whole merely a token body, the pressure group said.“Rather than democratizing the process, this section restricts choice to only male members of the village and also to only certain clans for some villages. The Bill fails to provide for Universal Adult Franchise by disenfranchising more than half of the indigenous population by denying women full electoral rights through the notion of ‘Teh Rangbah’ (Section 6 & Section 8). Secret Ballot System that will aid in ensuring fairness and legitimacy to any election is not even mentioned”, Kyrsoibor Pyrtuh and Angela Rangad said on behalf of TUR and added that the role of the Dong and the Rangbah/Dorbar Dong needs to be clearly laid out. They said that the attempt of the Bill is to snatch away village autonomy and peoples’ sovereignty by centralizing power with the Executive Committee of the District council through veto provisions particularly Section 19 that prescribes that the Executive Committee can summarily suspend or supersede the Rangbah Shnong, the Executive, the Village Development Council and any Committees formed in the village for gross violation of provisions of this act.Moreover, Section 13 provides for setting up of a Village Development Council which creates a new parallel structure that may impede decision making, accountability and transparency. “The Indigenous people of Khasi Jaintia Hills deserve a better legislation that will uphold their democratic rights as there is a need to have inclusive pre-legislative consultation to amend the Bill keeping in mind availability of the Bill in the local language, they said.

1780,Headmen’s body to go ahead with 12-hour Ri Bhoi bandh,"Monday, May 18, 2015","NONGPOH: The Dorbar ki Rangbah Shnong, Ri Bhoi District (DKRS) on Sunday decided to go ahead with the proposed 12-hour Ri Bhoi bandh on Tuesday.
Earlier, on Saturday, Umsning Assembly Youth Congress (UAYC) had urged the DKRS to defer the bandh in view of the declaration of SSLC and HSSLC (Arts) by MBOSE. However, the DKRS slammed the UAYC for misleading the public since the results are not slated to be declared on Tuesday.

1787,State Cabinet to fix GHADC poll date shortly,"Sunday, May 17, 2015","SHILLONG: The State Government will discuss the date for holding GHADC elections in the next cabinet meeting even as Union Home Ministry has come under fire for speaking in different tongues on the issue.
While the same Union Home Ministry earlier asked the State Government to delay the elections, in a change of stand, the Home Ministry has now favoured elections to GHADC.
During the last March Assembly session, the State Government had to desperately defend its  stand of  not holding elections to GHADC by quoting a letter  of  Ajay Kanoujia, Director (NE-II) that the elections should be delayed since the  Union Government was planning to  go for amendment to the Sixth Schedule of the constitution to increase seats in the council  from the current 30 to 40. The State Government had also come under flak from the  Opposition for the delay in holding GHADC elections.
However, recently, the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, in charge Northeast Shambu Singh told the Additional Chief Secretary in charge home and political  K. S. Kropha and ANVC  leaders in Delhi during a meeting  that the State Government was free to hold elections.
An official while pointing out the different stand of the Centre, said on Saturday that in the wake of new suggestion of Union Home Ministry not to link holding elections with amendment to constitution to increase seats in GHADC from the current 30 to 40 , the State Government will have to hold elections.
“The matter was to be listed in the last cabinet meeting, but since other issues came under discussion, the agenda will be listed in the next cabinet meeting”, the official added."
1788,Garo group steps into agitational mode,"Sunday, May 17, 2015","TURA: The All A’chik Youth Federation (AAYF) has decided to go ahead with its proposed agitation in view of the Government failing to respond to its demand for dissolution of the current executive committee of the GHADC to make way for the holding of fresh elections.
Earlier, the federation had served an ultimatum until May 15 for the Government to dissolve the present executive committee as well as to fix the date for election to the GHADC.
A one day office picketing of the GHADC in protest against the alleged illegal extension of its term was also organized under the banner of Joint Opposition Alliance (JOA) in which the federation participated.
The decision to go ahead with the proposed agitation comes after it failed to receive any kind of response or assurance from the Government even after the expiry of its ultimatum on Friday.
The agitation will begin with a poster campaign on May 18 followed by a Non Cooperation Movement (NCM) during the day on 19th and 20th. A Night Road Blockade is also being called from 5:00 pm to 5:00 am on 19th and 20th which will continue till the morning of 21st.
The federation, however, exempted hospitals, pharmacies, emergency service providers like the MeECL, water tankers, milk vans, ambulances, daily wagers including those with medical emergencies from the purview of both the NCM and night road blockade."

SHILLONG: The Mawlong unit of the HYC has urged the KHADC to take action against Kolkata based firm, Maheswari Mining Private Limited (MMPL) for allegedly drilling for uranium at Laiseng Sohsarat village without the knowledge of the local dorbar.
Laiseng Sohsarat village is located 20 kms away from Sohra.
Addressing newsmen here on Saturday, HYC Mawlong unit president, Rangdajied Khyne said the firm has drilled over 700 metres, which is way beyond the permissible limit of 150 metres, without seeking the consent of the village dorbar.

“Even the NOC was for evaluation of the limestone, but the firm conducted uranium drilling which is highly illegal,” the HYC Mawlong Unit president alleged.
He further claimed that the unscientific exploration for uranium which has left an exposed drilled hole has badly affected the people of the area who are suffering from various kinds of diseases.
He also said that the acting Sordar of Laiseng Sohsarat, S Laloo, who came to know of the matter recently, has cancelled the NOC given to the company.
“We urge the KHADC to take immediate action to stop the illegal operation of the firm,” Khyne added."

SHILLONG: Three murder cases and over Rs 31 crore damage suit filed against 14 pressure groups, will be followed up by the Government even after the withdrawal of 92 criminal cases.
The 92 criminal cases withdrawn by the Government are those registered under Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO) Act for damage to property of individuals and the Government, arsons and assaults resulting in injuries among others.
However, the pending cases related to the death of three persons after they were set on fire during the agitations demanding implementation of ILP in 2013, will be pursued by the Special Court.
The murder cases of 2013 due to petrol bomb attacks are of city residents , 74-year-old woman  Vidyadevi Chowkani (74), at Police Bazar on October 26, trader  Bikash Nandwal (44)  at Motphran on October 9  and Bisheshwar Kumar Das (50) at Bishnupur on November 16.

When this reporter contacted, a senior Government official said that even if anyone files an RTI application, exemption clause of the RTI Act will be cited to deny information.
“Anyone can approach Public Information Officer, the Appellate Authority, or  even the Chief Information Commissioner of the State or the court, but till it is notified in the gazette, we cannot provide the copy of the  ordinance”, the official asserted.
The State Government is banking on exemption under Section 8 (i) in The Right To Information Act, 2005 to deny information.
The section 8 (i) says, “Cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers: Provided that the decisions of Council of Ministers, the reasons thereof, and the material on the basis of which the decisions were taken shall be made public after the decision has been taken, and the matter is complete, or over: Provided further that those matters which come under the exemptions specified in this section shall not be disclosed”.
However, there is a provision to challenge the stand of the Government under the exemption section 8 (j) which says that “Provided that the information, which cannot be denied to the Parliament or a State Legislature shall not be denied to any person”.

As Khyriem came out of the Shillong Jail here, he was given a hero’s welcome by his supporters.
He was received by his family members, leaders and members of the 13 pro-ILP pressure groups outside the jail.
Khyriem was arrested at Sadar police station after he refused to accept the bailable warrant notice given to him by a police official of Rilbong police outpost. He did not accept the notice on the ground that such warrants should be sent to his residence.
The KSU chief was subsequently   sent to a 14-day judicial custody by the court of chief judicial magistrate after he refused bail.
The pro-ILP pressure groups on Thursday decided to seek bail for Khyriem after the Meghalaya government’s decision to withdraw all criminal cases filed against the group’s leaders and members during the ILP stir in 2013.
The 13 pressure groups, which include, among others, the KSU, the FKJGP and Hynniewtrep National Youth Front, had demanded a withdrawal of all the criminal cases following Khyriem’s arrest last week.
Soon after his release, Khyriem told the gathering, “This is not the end and from now onwards there will be intensive agitations if the government fails to address certain issues put before it.”
He threatened to launch intensive agitations if the State Government failed to implement the comprehensive mechanism to control influx and also passing of the village administration Bill to empower traditional institutions and headmen whose powers had been clipped by the Meghalaya High Court.
The KSU president also demanded the State Government to ensure that indigenous people of the State are exempted from the purview of the proposed Residential Bill and added that the Bill should be made applicable only for ‘outsiders’.
Expressing opposition on the recent ordinance to empower traditional institutions in the state passed by the State government, Khyriem made it clear that his organization would not accept it.
Later, a procession was also taken out by the KSU activists escorting their president from the jail all through Khyndailad area towards the office of the Union.
Shops and business establishments downed their shutters when the procession was passing through different areas of Khyndailad and other parts of the city."

1801,Doctor flees after getting demand note in GH,"Saturday, May 16, 2015","TURA: An extortion demand issued by unidentified miscreants has forced  the lone doctor working at Mangsang PHC in East Garo Hills to flee to its district headquarter, Williamnagar.
The Mangsang Regional Unit of the GSU, which brought the matter to light, informed that a note demanding Rs 50,00000 was sent to the concerned doctor through SMS by unknown miscreants recently which led the doctor to desert the place.
Following the incident, the GSU along with villagers and school students organized a public peace rally at Mangsang on Thursday. During the rally around 500 school students from the area while holding placards condemned the incident and made an appeal not to target public servants in future.
Meanwhile, in the absence of the doctor at the PHC the people of the area are forced to look elsewhere for their medical needs as well as other necessities like obtaining medical certificates.
“Since there is no doctor at the PHC we now have to travel to Williamnagar, Tura or Goalpara spending large amounts of money even for minor checkups. We are facing problems in obtaining  birth and death certificates as well as even to get necessary documents attested as there is no other Gazetted Officer in the area,” the GSU said.
The GSU along with other pressure groups recently also took up the matter with the District Medical Officer.

1803,Pynshngain set for 2nd innings as CEM,"Saturday, May 16, 2015","Metbah withdraws after 2 MDCs switch allegiance
SHILLONG: In a dramatic turn of events, People’s Democratic Front (PDF) chairman Pynshngain N Syiem on Friday was elected unopposed as the 38th Chief Executive Member (CEM) of KHADC after ARPA candidate Metbah Lyngdoh withdrew from the race at the last minute.
The announcement regarding Syiem’s election was made by the KHADC chairperson Teilinia Thangkhiew during the Council’s special session held here on Friday.
Syiem, a Congress MDC from Mawsynram, will hold the post of CEM for a second time.
Metbah Lyngdoh, a UDP MDC from Mairang, was compelled to withdraw from the race after two Independent MDCs — James Sylliang (Mawhati) and Grace Mary Kharpuri (Nongshken) — shifted their allegiance to the PDF which reduced the ruling coalition -ARPA — into a minority.
This is not the first time the two MDCs shifted their allegiance from one camp to another.
The State governor KN Tripathi had earlier directed the District Council Affairs department to convene the special session after ARPA leader Adelbert Nongrum resigned from CEM’s post following withdrawal of support by two MDCs — James Sylliang and Grace Mary Kharpuri.
At present, in the 30-member House, the PDF has the support of 16 MDCs including two independents while  ARPA has the strength of 13 MDCs (three KHNAM, five UDP and five HSPDP) minus the KHADC chairman.
Addressing the House after his election, the newly-elected CEM said that his immediate priority was to see the passing of the Village Administration Bill, 2015 and to improve the financial position of the Council.
“I am taking over at a time when there is a hue and cry over the High Court ruling derecognizing powers of traditional heads. As the CEM, I will try my level best to see the interest of the traditional institutions is well protected,” Syiem said.
He also stressed on the need to have a discussion with the State Government on the Village Administration Bill.
On the issue of improving financial position of the Council, Syiem said that it will not be a bad idea to have a financial consultant who can guide the Executive Committee (EC) to look at the new avenues for augmenting revenue collection.
The outgoing CEM Adelbert Nongrum, while congratulating his successor, emphasized that the members of the House should jointly ensure that the Village Administration Bill is passed by the State Government at the earliest."
1804,Salahuddin’s freedom delayed due to ill health,"Saturday, May 16, 2015","SHILLONG: It will be a long wait for the arrested ex-Minister of Bangladesh Salahuddin Ahmed before he gets out of Meghalaya as his adverse health condition has delayed the legal process for his release.
Ahmed, who was lodged at Civil Hospital since Tuesday after his arrest on the previous day, is yet to be produced before the Court due to his adverse health condition. Since Saturday and Sunday being holidays, he is likely to be produced sometime next week. Meghalaya police has already intimated to the Court the inability to produce him as he is unwell.
For the second time, the Assistant Office Secretary of BNP, Central Committee Jony  Abdul Latif met Ahmed on Friday at Civil Hospital and conveyed to the media that he needs better medical treatment at Singapore where he used to go for regular health check up to cure his kidney ailment and heart disease as infrastructure facilities in this regard  are not available in  Shillong Civil Hospital .
“He seems to be weak and is not sleeping well due to his heart disease and his ailment related to kidney”, Jony said.
The BNP functionary said that he and his family members will approach the authorities concerned for his treatment outside India. They are in touch with some senior local lawyers here to take up the matter with the Court.
However, the delay in the arrival of Ahmed’s wife since she is yet to get Indian visa will be a hurdle for taking any decision to file an appeal before the Court to  shift Ahmed outside the country for medical treatment.
Moreover, early release of Ahmed is unlikely since the case is related to violation of Foreigner’s Act as he did not possess valid travel documents while entering India.
Legal experts said that the Court may send him first to judicial custody which means that he has to serve the sentence in jail to be pronounced by the Court. The imprisonment varies from three to six months."
1805,Resisting Administrator’s Rule a moral victory for ARPA,"Saturday, May 16, 2015","SHILLONG: Despite losing power in the KHADC, HSPDP MDC Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit said that foiling the State Government’s attempt to impose Administrator’s Rule in the Council was a moral victory for the ARPA.
“It is a moral victory for ARPA. We have defeated the forced attempt of the State Government to impose AR in the Council,” Basaiawmoit said while addressing the House after the election of new CEM Pynshngain N Syiem during the special session of the KHADC on Friday.
“The PDF should thank us for getting an opportunity to form the new Executive Committee through this special session which was demanded by ARPA,” Basaiawmoit said.
He said that from the very beginning, the alliance had voiced its strong opposition to this “undemocratic” decision of the Government.
According to Basaiawmoit, the Government was compelled to convene this special session since the Governor had rejected its recommendations.
Basaiawmoit takes a dig at Grace, James
While coming down heavily on the two independent MDCs (Grace Mary Kharpuri and James Sylliang) indirectly for frequently shifting their allegiance, he said that it is difficult to change certain people’s inappropriate behavior.
“But they will have to be answerable for their action in front of the public,” Basaiawmoit asserted.
Meanwhile, reacting to the statement of Sohiong MDC and District Council Affairs (DCA) Minister HDR Lyngdoh in the House urging the newly elected CEM Pynshngaiñ N Syiem to properly look after the sheep (referring to the MDCs) so that they do not run away, HSPDP MDC said that they never knew there were wolves who were out to pounce on their sheep.
“We would have been more alert if we had known about the wolves before,” Basaiawmoit said.
He also indirectly slammed the DCA Minister saying different things at the Cabinet, Assembly and Council.
In a word of caution to the newly elected CEM, the HSPDP MDC said that Syiem should take all precaution to see that he does not face the same fate as his immediate predecessors (Adelbert Nongrum and Basaiawmoit) whose EC collapsed within 6 months.
Meanwhile, UDP MDC and ARPA chairman Metbah Lyngdoh said that he is happy to see that the struggle of ARPA in opposing the imposition of Administrator’s Rule in the Council was a successful one.
“The main reason for my withdrawing from the race for the CEM’s post was to avoid causing instability in the Council,” Lyngdoh said.
Meanwhile, KHADC chairman Teilinia Thangkhiew said that the image of the Council had taken a beating in the eyes of the public owing to the frequent change of leadership in the past few months.
“I hope that we will try to again lift the image of the Council by giving priority to its interests rather than focusing on the interest of few of the MDCs,” Thangkhiew added."

1817,Mystery shrouds Salahuddin’s escapade to Shillong,"Friday, May 15, 2015","SHILLONG: Three days after Bangladesh ex-Minister Salahuddin Ahmed’s dramatic entry into Shillong, there is no definite clue about the circumstances leading to his surfacing in the city at the crack of dawn on Monday.
However, speculations are rife about a possible desperation to save himself that Ahmed took the risk of sneaking out of his country through clandestine route to Shillong.
It is also a popular conjecture that the wanted man in Bangladesh managed “local support” in making the perilous journey across the porous border.
On Thursday, there were a flurry of activities in Shillong following arrival of a number of Ahmed’s aides and associates. There are already talks of his seeking political asylum in India thereby strengthening the theory that Ahmed was trying to run for his life in Bangladesh.
Two relatives of Ahmed and a Bangladeshi exporter met him in Civil Hospital. They were assisted by a Khasi exporter from Shella and two Dawki residents.
Ayub Ali from Kolkata, who claims to be the cousin of Ahmed said after meeting him that the BNP leader was in the custody of some unidentified persons for 62 days and the abductors shifted him in different vehicles finally landing up near Golf course, Shillong blindfolded.
Ali, quoting Ahmed said that the BNP leader had gone to Pasteur beat house to report to the police after he landed up here, which, however was contradicted by the Meghalaya police by saying that it was the residents of the area who spotted him wandering and reported to the beat house.
The Khasi exporter from Shella who was accompanying Ali, said that he was just assisting the Bangladeshi residents to meet Ahmed and did not have any other role.
However, police doubt the kidnapping angle as claimed by the BNP leader.
“We cannot confirm the kidnapping theory as we have not interrogated him thoroughly since he is a heart patient,” East Khasi Hills SP M. Kharkrang said.
However, two personnel from Special Branch of Meghalaya police quizzed him for two hours at the hospital on Thursday, but they could not gather anything new as the politician maintained whatever he had already told the media.
Though Ahmed thanked Indian Government for giving him medical treatment and shelter, it is not clear whether he will be seeking political asylum in India since he is hunted by the Government forces in Bangladesh.
A senior home department official said that the BNP leader can seek political asylum in India provided that he writes to the Centre citing that he is harassed by the Government forces.
He however, said that as far as entry into India without travel documents is concerned, the law will take its own course.
Meanwhile, Ahmed, who is lodged at Civil Hospital, on Thursday thanked the Indian Government for giving him shelter and medical treatment after his arrest here on Monday.
Ahmed conveyed this to his close party associate and family friend Jony Md. Abdul Latif, who visited him at Shillong Civil Hospital assisted by two Khasi residents from Dawki on Thursday night.
Earlier during the day, the wife of Ahmed, Hasina Ahmed told media in Dhaka that Jony, the assistant office secretary of BNP, had left for Shillong to meet her husband.
In Shillong after meeting Ahmed, Jony told The Shillong Times that he came to meet Ahmed as a family friend and not as a political leader, and the aim of the visit was to inquire about his health.
Jony said that Ahmed conveyed to him that he was not keeping well and there is a need for further medical treatment at some other hospitals as he was taking medicines as per the prescriptions of a doctor from Singapore due to heart disease and ailment related to kidney.
“I came to know about his detention in Shillong from his wife who is not able to come to Shillong as her visa is yet to be cleared,” Jony said.
He also said that the arrested spokesperson of BNP did not give any information to him regarding how he landed up in Shillong without travel documents.
Asked about the political witch hunt by the ruling Bangladesh government against BNP leaders, Jony said that unlike India, Canada, US and Britain, the situation is different in Bangladesh.  However, he did not elaborate.
Jony said that only after his wife’s arrival in Shillong she can pursue the legal case and also any request for political asylum since he was arrested under Foreigners’ Act.
Earlier, during the day, several media persons from Dhaka and Kolkata arrived in Shillong and waited to meet Ahmed, but in vain as police did not give them permission."

Speaking to The Shillong Times, BSF PRO SK Singh asserted that BSF does not know how he must have crossed over to India saying BSF manages a long and porous border with Bangladesh.
The BSF official has also ruled out any inquiry into the incident.
The top opposition politician from Bangladesh who was reported missing since March 10 last surfaced in Pynthorumkhrah locality on Tuesday early morning and Meghalaya police arrested him immediately for entering India without valid documents.
The particular incident has once again raised speculations that there may be gaps along the border which may have been used by Salahuddin Ahmed to cross over to Meghalaya from Bangladesh.
It may be mentioned that border fencing has been completed in the jurisdiction of eight out of nine BSF Companies deployed in the border in Meghalaya.
“Border fencing work is going on in Dawki and Western side and around 55-60 km of border is yet to be fenced,” Singh said."
1840,Interpol alerts State on Salahuddin,"Thursday, May 14, 2015","SHILLONG: Meghalaya police received an Interpol alert to keep strict vigil on Bangladeshi politician Salahuddin Ahmed, who was arrested here on Monday.
Ahmed, who entered Meghalaya without valid travel documents, is currently lodged at the room meant for the under trial prisoners at Shillong Civil Hospital under heavy security cover.
He is yet to be produced before the Court.
“We have received an Interpol alert on Tuesday from CBI which is the Interpol agency in India about the arrested person”, DGP Rajiv Mehta told The Shillong Times on Wednesday.
The state police chief said that Meghalaya police responded to the Interpol alert by stating that Ahmed is in police custody.
“We are waiting for further direction from CBI for the future course of action”, the DGP said.
Asked whether the CBI team will arrive here to quiz Ahmed, Mehta said that no such information has come from the investigation agency. “As far as Meghalaya police is considered, since Ahmed has violated Foreigners’ Act, he will be produced before the Court after he is released from Civil Hospital where he is still lodged since he is unwell”, the DGP said.
Mehta said that the wife of Ahmed was yet to contact the Meghalaya police.
Police added that the politician had only some medicines with him when he was arrested on Monday.
Meghalaya police, however, are probing how Ahmed, who did not have any valid travel documents, landed up in Shillong from Bangladesh though he claimed that he was kidnapped in a vehicle by some persons."

SHILLONG: The office picketing called by the HSPDP in protest against the High Court of Meghalaya ruling derecognizing the powers of the headmen failed to evoke much response in the capital city on the first day.
The HSPDP has, however, decided to continue with the office picketing on Thursday.
State government employees on Wednesday defied the office picketing call and attended their offices normally.
The Deputy Commissioner’s office also functioned normally with healthy attendance.
However, Central government offices including several branches of State Bank of India including the Secretariat Branch and post offices across the city remained closed throughout the day leading to harassment of the customers.
A State Government official expressed dissatisfaction over the closure of many Central government offices in the city and claimed that the Central government employees had found a reason to go on leave.
Meanwhile, security was beefed up in different parts of the city with deployment of CRPF and local police personnel.
In view of the HSPDP’s week-long office picketing in all districts of Khasi and Jaintia Hills, the State government has directed its employees to attend office and carry on with their normal duties besides warning of strict action against all unauthorized absence.
Meanwhile, the State government, in a statement issued on Wednesday, reiterated that it was firm in its commitment to maintain law and order at all costs and to ensure that the security of its citizens was not compromised in any way.
“Government employees are advised not to pay any heed to this unreasonable call (office picketing) and to come out as they would on any normal day and carry on with their daily activities without any fear or apprehension of reprisals,” the statement said.
The statement added that the government was alive to the issue and cited the passage of the Meghalaya Local Administration (Empowerment of Traditional Institutions, Traditional Bodies and Headmen in Governance and Public Delivery System) Ordinance, 2015, which seeks to provide a legal mandate to the association of traditional institutions in the Government developmental programmes and delivery of public services.
The State government has advised the district administrations to take all necessary measures to maintain law and public order at all costs and take stern action if any attempts are made by anyone to disrupt the smooth    functioning of government offices, banks etc., or to paralyze the administration or to cause any damage to government and private property, under the relevant provision of the law, including the Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order Acts.

Defence PRO Amit Mahajan, while reacting to a news item, on Wednesday said that the local Army authorities have only expressed willingness to ‘consider proposals’ once received and never ‘expressed willingness to hand over their land’ to the Government of Meghalaya.
Stating that the consideration, if at all, will only be on offer of ‘equal value land’ contiguous to current Defence land holding and not ‘equal measure of land’, the PRO also termed as false the report that the Defence establishment had agreed in principle to hand over land near Garrison Ground for expansion of the road from Civil Hospital junction to General’s Point.
“The Defence establishment has never expressed any such agreement,” the PRO claimed.
According to Mahajan, the only proposal which is under favourable consideration with the local Defence establishment is the proposal to make available Defence land for construction of a flyover from Raps Mansion to Sweeper’s Colony only on offer of ‘equal value’ land in exchange.
Stating that the State Government has not approached the Defence establishment with any formal proposal after identifying land to be offered to the Army, Mahajan said the final ‘agreement’ for exchange of land can only be arrived at after the proposal is received, examined and finally accepted at the level of the Ministry of Defence after the same is concurred to by the Integrated Headquarter of the Ministry of Defence (Army)."

The awards were presented at Rashtrapati Bhavan on the occasion of International Nurses Day.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India instituted the National Florence Nightingale Awards in 1973 as a mark of recognition for the meritorious services of nurses.

Pangniang, told newsmen after the meeting held at Jaiaw Shyiap Lumpyllon, Community Hall.
He said that there was unanimity among the MDCs that the bill is the best possible solution to address the present stalemate arising of the High Court of Meghalaya ruling which questioned the role of the Rangbah Shnong.
Pangniang also informed that the meeting has decided to urge all the Himas who do not have their own Act to initiate the exercise to frame rules to define the roles and responsibility of the Rangbah Shnong.
The EM further mentioned that a meeting would be convened with all the traditional heads to collect their views and suggestion on preserving the customs and tradition.
The meeting also requested KHADC CEM Adelbert Nongrum to withdraw his decision to sit on an indefinite hunger strike.
On the issue of NOC, Pangniang informed that the KHADC EC will hold an emergency meeting to discuss the proposal of NOCs being issued by the District Council.

“The right to make laws to protect and preserve our custom and tradition lies with the District Council and not with the government or the parliament,” he said, while adding, “I would rather lay my own life than sacrificing the life and future of my own people.”
Cabbies against KHADC making laws on headmen
The East Khasi Hills Local Taxi Welfare Association on Tuesday maintained that the KHADC cannot make laws to defining the role and powers of the Rangbah Shnong as the Sanat (appointment letter) to the Rangbah Shnong is issued by the Hima and other traditional institutions like Syiemship and Raid.
“Therefore, the mandate to make laws on the Rangbah Shnong lies with the various traditional institutions since they are the authority who issue appointment letters to the Rangbah Shnong,” the cabbies said.
“The Village Administration Bill, 2015 which was formulated by the Council to define the roles and function of the Rangbah Shnong is totally against our traditional practices. The KHADC never consulted the traditional bodies while formulating this legislation. The Council is trying to impose the Bill which is unacceptable,” it said.
The cabbies’ body accused the HSPDP and other regional parties to trying to take political mileage out of the ruling of the High Court.
“The ruling of the High Court is not a permanent one. The ruling will lapse once the traditional institutions come up with law to define the powers of the Rangbah Shnong,” EKJHLTWA said, adding that it was surprising that the HSPDP had gone ahead with a public rally to mislead the people instead of giving the true picture on the whole issue.
EKHLTWA also blamed the Government of trying to create law and order problem by arresting KSU president Daniel Khyriem.
The cabbies recalled that a Government committee headed by former Deputy Chief Minister Bindo Mathew Lanong had suggested the implementation of ILP in the State and said, “Even Lanong should be arrested being the Chairman of the committee which recommended the implementation of the ILP to the Government.”"

Shillong: While improper planning and rapid urbanization continue to take its toll in overcrowded Shillong city, the Joint Special Committee comprising State government officials and Defence authorities has not been able to make much headway as far as its duties were concerned.
The Committee was constituted in 2013 to expedite the process of handing over of Defence land in the city to the Government but as usual unavailability of land has created obstacles in its path.
Army authorities have time and again expressed their willingness to hand over their land to the Government  in the city provided that they are allotted equal measure of the land by the State government which had even identified land for the Army authorities in Ri Bhoi but things did not go as planned.
While the Committee is yet to make any significant progress, Shillong city continues to become more congested with a growing number of vehicles and the same old and narrow roads which often lead to huge traffic jams.
With the narrow roads chock-a-block with unending lines of vehicles, the plan of the State government to construct flyovers in the city has remained a non-starter though the plan was conceived years back.
A flyover from the Civil Hospital junction to General’s Point was about to become a reality as the Defence establishment had agreed in principle to hand over 0.339 square kilometer of land near Garrison Ground to the State government and had demanded equal measure of land in return but the dilly dally tactic of the State government has prevented the proposed flyover from becoming a reality.
There was another proposal to construct a flyover from Raps Mansion to Sweeper Lane but the project   could never take off as the land acquisition problem was never solved.
Earlier it was believed that the thousands of trucks, both loaded and unloaded, which ply through the capital city were the root cause of traffic jams in Shillong, but the myth was busted when the Shillong Bypass was opened to traffic two years back (May, 2013) and traffic jams have continued to remain a daily feature in the life of Shillong residents.
Incidentally, the State government has remained unperturbed at the failure of the flyover plans as is evident from the fact that the State’s PWD minister has asked his department officials to survey the area from Umshyrpi River till 7th Mile in Upper Shillong to study the feasibility of constructing a flyover to ease traffic problems on that route.
Mention must also be made of the ambitious idea of the Meghalaya government to introduce cable cars and mono rails to de-congest Shillong city which, however, sank without a trace."

1869,"Govt playing politics on headmen issue, Lanong claims","Wednesday, May 13, 2015","SHILLONG: Accusing the State government of politicizing the issue of Rangbah Shnong in the context of the ruling of the High Court of Meghalaya, the UDP has demanded that the Meghalaya Local Administration (Empowerment of Traditional Institutions, Traditional Bodies and Headmen in Governance Delivery System) Ordinance, 2015 should immediately be revoked.
“The matter would have been resolved if the Government had passed the Village Administration Bill, 2015. The ruling of the Court would have died its natural death,” UDP working president Bindo Mathew Lanong told newsmen here on Wednesday.
He lamented that the State government had played politics over the issue.
According to Lanong, the Bill is in the State government’s court but it does not want to forward the same to the Governor for assent. “They want to take it up themselves to gain political mileage,” Lanong alleged.
Questioning the jumbo-sized committee headed by former Chief Minister D.D. Lapang, he said that the committee was given two months after it was constituted on March 4.
“The committee never met until the expiry of its deadline. We could not meet to either discuss or to give suggestion. Here also the Government betrayed the faith and confidence extended by the people who attended the meeting and now, they have acted arbitrarily by issuing the ordinance,” he said, while demanding that the Ordinance be revoked since the State government does not have the authority to formulate any legislation to empower the traditional institutions.
According to Lanong, under the State List Para 5 of the Seventh Schedule, the State Government can make laws only for the purpose of supporting the areas of local self government like municipal, panchayat, district council and other institutions.
The UDP working president said that in this case, the KHADC does not require the support of the State Government. “We are all aware that the district council had forwarded the Village Administration Bill and recently sent an amended version after correcting some shortcomings. As per my contention, the situation will be resolved if the State Government forwards it to the Governor for his assent,” he added."

1873,NESFAS holds orientation on open defecation free status,"Wednesday, May 13, 2015","SHILLONG: The North East Slow Food and Agro-biodiversity Society (NESFAS) in collaboration with the District Water and Sanitation Mission (DWSM), East Khasi Hills, organised a State-level orientation programme on open defecation free (ODF) status, at the Gurudwara, Sikh Centre, in the city on Tuesday for 43 communities from across Meghalaya.
The congregation was facilitated by Mark West Kharkongor, District Coordinator, Water & Sanitation Mission, who has been active in mobilizing the villages within his reach, towards achieving the ODF status.
Kharkongor started off the programme saying, “No one can define cleanliness with a single definition; it is relative”.
Using his renowned, unique practical approach in addressing rural sanitation issues, Mark saw to it that the orientation should be ’embedded in the head and not just on your note-pad’.
Calling upon two volunteers, he handed them two bags each and told them to put clean items in one bag and dirty ones in the other. He said that if the bag with dirty items gets filled faster than the other one, it suggests that the area is dirty. The same exercise can be applied at the community level.
Kharkongor further stated, “Campaign on cleanliness starts with water”, before he ventured into the topics of water & sanitation. He gave a practical demonstration to emphasize that cleanliness and dirt cannot co-exist, by dropping a dirty stone into a glass of clean water.
Kharkongor’s orientation style resonates his belief that if a change should start at the personal level. He further emphasizes this by asking, “If one can spend on mobile recharges regularly, why can’t one spend on building toilets?”
The programme came to an end with Kharkongor listing three criteria for each village to be open defecation free – Toilets, Clean Water and Garbage-free.
On an ending note, Kharkongor stated, “There is no such thing as waste. The things we call waste are the ones we don’t need. But tell me is there any waste that cannot be reused? We can even make use of the sewage or the nitrogen rich urine”.
“Most of our sanitary problems are due to not returning waste to nature and thus breaking the cycle. Cleanliness comes first into existence, not dirt,” he said.
This programme marks the beginning of future series of orientation on the same topic of ODF. The next plan of action would take place at the district level.
The 43 communities which attended the programme will partner NESFAS in hosting the upcoming International Mei-Ramew (IMR), scheduled for November 2015."

Lanong, who had also served as KHADC CEM and MDC in the past said on Monday that there is no provision of law for the state government to bring out an ordinance as only the district council has such absolute power.
“I want to know under which provision of the law, the state government can make law for an autonomous body which is the purely recognized by Constitution”, Lanong said , adding that para 3 (5) of Sixth Schedule is specific about the powers of district councils with respect to the appointment of chiefs and headmen. He added that the ordinance will not stand the test of time.
If the district council challenges the ordinance in the Court,  it will be scrapped as the ordinance is null and void, he added.
Lanong also pointed out that the cabinet meeting was attended only by 50 percent of members as many ministers were absent.
Lanong, who is also a member of the Government appointed Committee to institutionalize headmen, wondered as to the delay in convening the meeting to discuss the matter.
It was on March 2 that the Government convened a meeting and subsequently   instituted nearly 50 member committee headed by former Chief Minister DD Lapang giving time of two months to submit report on empowerment of headmen, but in vain as not a single meeting was convened and the Government has   violated its own decision by agreeing to an ordinance  without convening the meeting of the committee, Lanong added."

1881,Tynsong opens 1st bio-digester toilets,"Tuesday, May 12, 2015","Nongbah:Myrdon Village in Ri Bhoi district gets the first ever bio-digester toilets in Meghalaya and the North East.  Myrdon Village under the leadership of the Rangbah Shnong, Bipul Thangkhiew  had earlier donated about 5 acres of land to the Government for creation of the Rural Technology Centre. Minister for Community and Rural Development, Prestone Tynsong  inaugurated this innovative toilet – a technology borrowed from the Antarctic region.
Biodigester Septic Tank (BST) is an on-site sanitation unit that utilizes anaerobic technology for the disposal of faecal matter, toilet (black) wastewater as well as of kitchen and bathroom (grey) water, in a closed system. This technology replaces the septic tanks and absorption pits which scientists say are not viable for a hilly area like Meghalaya. The tank only needs to be fed with inoculum, a kind of bacteria that converts faecal matter to manure. Currently the inoculums is being developed in a research station at Guwahati and is readily available.
This is a low-cost toilet which could well turn Meghalaya into a state where open defecation will be a thing of the past and consequently the number of water borne diseases too would be greatly curtailed.
While addressing the villagers of Myrdon village, Tynsong said he first heard of this technology at the Centre for Innovation in Public Systems (CIPS) Hyderabad, headed by retired IAS officer, D Chakrapani. Tynsong and had visited this place at the behest of Principal Secretary, C & RD, KN Kumar. The duo along with Chakrapani then visited Lakshwadeep to see for themselves how the biodigesters worked very successfully in that island. It was then that Tynsong felt Meghalaya should also benefit from this technology.
Exhorting the villagers of Myrdon to partner with the Government, Tynsong said, ‘Never say that the Government alone can do something for the people. Ask instead what you can do for your family, society, village and the state. We need two hands to clap and Government can only succeed if people actively partner with us,” Tynsong added.
Reminding people that environmental protection is paramount in Meghalaya, Tynsong who is also the Minister for Forest and Environment, said on June 5 this year which is World Environment Day, an  official programme will be held at Nongpoh where one lakh trees are earmarked to be planted on that day in the entire Ri Bhoi District. “If we cut a tree we are cutting down and destroying a generation, since one tree takes at least 50 years to grow. Let every member of each family plant a sapling on June 5,” Tynsong urged.
Meanwhile CIPS has trained 7 young, ‘competent’ engineers to launch the bio-digester  project in the state. They were sent for further training to Gwalior. Now the engineers are ready to get into action.
Earlier, environmentalist  C Srinivasan popularly known as Vellore Srinivasan who has revolutionised waste management in Vellore and several places in South India and had recently trained 74 people from Myrdon and adjoining villages, explained his concept ‘Solid and Liquid Resource Management’ (SLRM) to the audience. In Srinivasan’s book there is nothing called waste since mostly everything can be turned into a resource which is either manure or money.
The trained personnel demonstrated how leaf waste (mulch) can be turned into manure in 60 days by applying cow dung and cow’s urine ( which according to Srinivasan is a rich source of hormones). The bacteria acts on the dry leaves and turns it into rich manure which enhances soil fertility. “We have seen how fruit trees have increased their yield by four times,” Srinivasan said.
“Meghalaya is fortunate to avail the technology which has been tested in several other states and after much improvement is now ready for application,” Srinivasan explained. He however cautioned that the silver lined packages such as those containing Uncle Chips etc., continue to remain the biggest challenge because there is as yet no technology to tackle this sort of waste.
It may be mentioned that Myrdon Village is quietly following in the footsteps of Mawlynnong billed as Asia’s cleanest village. Indeed what stand out are the red and green buckets (for inorganic and organics waste respectively) hanging from trees in the village to be used by passers- by.
Nongbah-Myrdon has been nurtured by Deputy Director, SIRD, Banteilang Rumnong since 2011. “We have worked closely with the people here. It’s been a slow process but worth the while when we see the transformation of the village,” Rumnong said adding that the Rangbah Shnong, B Thangkhiew has an open, progressive mind and is keen to partner with the Government for the overall benefit of the village.
At the end of the inaugural function the villagers of Myrdon village took a solemn oath to keep their village clean at all times and not to burn leaves or any form of garbage."

The police action came about after The Shillong Times management and staff filed two separate FIRs with Tura police and began the process of moving the High Court against the Youth Congress which not only threatened the staff and paper agents but also blocked the circulation and tore copies of the daily in Tura on Saturday morning.

All three self-styled political leaders were later released on bail.
The Youth Congress members led by Richard Marak had threatened paper agents and hawkers from selling The Shillong Times alleging that the management was not giving up to date news to the readers.
On Saturday morning they prevented the newspaper circulation from being distributed to the readers and even tore the covers of the copies which were being dispatched to different parts of Garo Hills.
Following the unruly incidents the staff and management filed two police reports (FIR) at Tura police station and have also decided to move the high court against the Youth Congress.
The Shillong Times has decided to raise the issue of infringement of democratic rights of a citizen under Article 19 of the Constitution of India in the court.

1891,No attention given to lack of skilled workers in India: Badal,"Tuesday, May 12, 2015","SHILLONG: Punjab Chief Minister and Chairman of the Sub Group of the Chief Ministers on Skill Development, Prakash Singh Badal, on Monday expressed concern over the dismal percentage of skilled workers in the country which stood at a mere 12 per cent.
Speaking to media persons after the meeting of the Sub Group of the Chief Ministers on Skill Development here on Monday, Badal said the percentage of skilled workers was more than 80-90 per cent in developed countries.
While admitting that not much attention was being given to the problem of unskilled workers in the country, Badal said the human factor is the most important for the progress of the country but attention has not been paid on this aspect. Mentioning that skill was the most important requirement, Badal said, “The more the percentage of skilled workers, the higher will be the per capita income.”
According to Badal, the greatest problem of the country is unemployment and the main reason for unemployment is the lack of skill among the workers.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had constituted a board of   chief ministers to prepare details on how to make India a skilled nation. Other chief minister not included in the Board can present their views till June 25.
Badal said the group is at the discussion level right now and thereafter will prepare the final reports. The next meeting of the Sub Group is slated to be held in Chhattisgarh.
Surprisingly, with the exception of the Meghalaya Chief Minister and Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister nabam Tuki, none of the chief ministers from other Northeastern and eastern states attended this all-important meeting.
The Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Skill Development which was formed by the Governing Council of NITI Aayog with the Punjab chief minister as Convener; chief ministers of Meghalaya, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Tripura as members and CEO of NITI Aayog as the Coordinator.
The meeting was participated by 13 states. Three states – Punjab, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh – were represented by their chief ministers; Mizoram, Nagaland and Assam were represented by their ministers and Tripura by the chief secretary; while Sikkim, Chhattisgarh, Manipur, Puducherry, Bihar and Odisha were represented by their respective government officers.
The objective of the meeting was to deliberate on measures to enhance capacity and improve standards of skilling at the State level, examine private sector participation in skill development and to suggest ways for improved partnership of private sector in curriculum development, delivery mechanism, pedagogy, certification, apprenticeship training and propose measures to expand outreach of skilling programmes, particularly in demographically advantageous states.
Some of the important issues discussed in the regional consultation meeting were implementation structure of skill development programmes in the States, shortage of trainers, utilizing the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare funds available with the States for skill development, harnessing of traditional skills, making best use of the resources and opportunities available with the states, promoting local entrepreneurship in viable sectors and the funding requirement for Skill Development Programmes.
Earlier, in his opening address, the Punjab chief minister expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his timely action in setting up the sub-committee to address ‘the most important issue in the country’.
Stating that India is the youngest nation country in the world with 65 per cent of its population below 35 years of age, Badal said, “After Independence care has not been taken about the issue and India has remained an unskilled nation lagging far behind other countries in skill development.”
He added that it is the vision of the Prime Minister to make each and every youth of the country skilled employable citizens.
Badal also stressed on the need to link skill training to placement, to motivate the youth that skill is more important than having government jobs and to work on a mission mode. With more unemployed youths in the rural areas, he also called for skill up gradation in agriculture and allied activities.
Arunachal Chief Minister Nabam Tuki also apprised the meeting of the skill development programmes being taken in his state since 2012 and its plans to have an ITI in every district with job- oriented courses and requested the Central government to make skill development a mission-mode programme.

1899,Govt to meet shortly to decide on GHADC polls,"Monday, May 11, 2015","SHILLONG: The Meghalaya Cabinet will convene a meeting soon to discuss the issue of holding elections to the GHADC in the wake of the suggestion from the Union Ministry of Home Affairs that the government should not wait for the amendment to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution to hold the polls since the process of amendment will take a long period of time.
A State Home department official informed The Shillong Times on Sunday that the District Council Affairs department will have to act on the MHA suggestion and obtain necessary Cabinet approval for holding the much-delayed GHADC polls.
Earlier on Thursday, Joint Secretary in charge Northeast, Ministry of Home Affairs, Shambhu Singh, had conveyed the need to hold the GHADC elections to Meghalaya Additional Chief Secretary K.S. Kropha and ANVC-ANVC-B leaders during their meeting in New Delhi.
According to Singh, since the amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution will take more time, this should not be linked to holding of elections to the GHADC.
The State Government had delayed the elections to the GHADC since February, 2014 by stating one reason or another including citing pending amendment to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which will increase the seats of GHADC from the current 30 to 40.
However, with the stand of MHA now clear vis-à-vis the GHADC elections, the State government is left with no alternative other than announcing elections to the 30 seats in the GHADC."
1900,Noted Tura teacher abducted at gunpoint,"Monday, May 11, 2015","Tura: Gaganendra Sanyal, a retired teacher of Don Bosco School who worked tirelessly to get thousands of young girls and boys involved in the Scouts and Guides programme and was helping out in a school for orphans, has been abducted at gunpoint from Jekabari, near Garobadha, on Saturday night.
Four armed locals came in a car to the farm house where Gaganendra Sanyal, fondly known as Sir Sanyal by his past pupils, was staying.
The four armed men forcibly entered the house, at approximately 8:40 pm, and took the aged teacher away despite appeals by his wife and other inmates of the house to spare him.
“They came in fast and took him away before anyone could stop them. It was over in a matter of minutes,” said a witness from the house.
He added that all the men were locals.
The abduction of the teacher has spread shock and fear among the teaching fraternity.
Sanyal had been a teacher at Tura Don Bosco School for well over 35 years beginning his career in the early 1970s. He was the architect of the annual sports events in the school and as a   teacher was a formidable disciplinarian.
Many of today’s officers, leaders, businessmen and sportspersons from Garo Hills have been his students.
He spread the Scouts and Guides movement to hundreds of schools in Garo Hills and was acknowledged for his dedication with a President and Governor’s awards.
His missionary zeal led him to the Ram Krishna Mission at Jekabari, post his retirement from Don Bosco School.
Despite suffering from a debilitating nerve disorder which hampers his walking, Master Sanyal had been teaching the orphans of the school for the past three years."

1903,NPP slams CM for delaying Council polls,"Monday, May 11, 2015","SHILLONG: Following the assertion of the Ministry of Home Affairs that the Meghalaya government was free to hold elections to the GHADC at any time, the Opposition NPP has criticized the chief minister for fooling the people and the ANVC and ANVC-B by delaying the elections to the Council.
Speaking to The Shillong Times, NPP legislator James Sangma said that the chief minister’s excuses were plenty on the delay in holding GHADC elections and, moreover, the delay had served only the personal interests of the Chief Minister.
The NPP legislator alleged that the democratic process of holding elections to GHADC was scuttled illegally and unconstitutionally and demanded that the chief minister should immediately declare elections.
One of the main reasons why the chief minister delayed the elections was that he was not confident of winning the polls due to the adverse situation affecting the Congress in Garo Hills on all fronts, the NPP leader claimed.
Blaming the chief minister as solely responsible for the mess in the GHADC, the NPP leader wanted to know whether the tenure of the GHADC will be for five years once elections are held or just three and a half years as one and half years have already lapsed with the three-time extension of the Council’s tenure."

1912,Institutionalisation of Nokmas opposed,"Monday, May 11, 2015","SHILLONG: While there is a demand for institutionalization of traditional bodies and heads in Khasi and Jaintia Hills, ANVC-B leader Bernard Rimpu Marak has opposed the State Government’s move to institutionalise the Nokmas.
“Aking Nokmas are independent tribal heads whose powers, functions and authority cannot be institutionalized by the state,” Marak said in a statement issued on Sunday.
According to Marak, the state government will be crossing its parameter in its move to institutionalize the Nokmas.
“Aking Nokmas are recognized traditional heads who are custodians of land and traditional administrators in Garo hills. The move to institutionalize the Nokmas immediately after we signed the agreed text which aims to empower the traditional bodies and streamline direct funding to the grass root level is definitely a move to counter our agreement,” Marak said.
“We agreed to strengthen our traditional system, our Nokmas, our tribal administration and GHADC which have been weakened due to political institutionalization of MDCs in GHADC,” he said.
According to Marak, MDCs, who are tribal representatives were institutionalized politically and put under checks and balances to serve political purposes thus defeating the objective of the Sixth Schedule institution.
“Our agreement aims at restructuring our tribal administrative system under Sixth Schedule which is weakened due to political interference. Hence a move to institutionalize the traditional heads at this juncture will curtail the power and authority of the Nokmas in Garo hills through politically inclined bodies which are closely associated with the ruling political party,” the ANVC-B leader said.
Marak said that institutionalizing Nokmas will not empower them, but instead weaken them and restrict their authority in their own Aking land just like the way MDCs are restricted from making ‘free’ decision in GHADC. Institutionalizing the Nokmas will concentrate their power under one banner. This is a dangerous trend as the body in which the Nokmas are institutionalized will ultimately turn out to be under political influence, Marak said, adding that this does not serve the tribal purpose."

SHILLONG: In a unique suggestion, the Congress-led Opposition in KHADC, People’s Democratic Front (PDF), has said that pending the empowerment of headmen, the KHADC can take up the task of issuing certificates as the Council has legal sanction compared to the headmen.
The PDF after a meeting held here on Saturday felt that till the Government empowers headmen legally, the KHADC can be entrusted with the task of issuing various certificates.
In another decision PDF decided to ask the Government to give its nod to the Village Administration Bill which, according to PDF, will solve the present crisis.
Moreover, the meeting also decided that both PDF and the ARPA will jointly convene a ‘Peoples’ Assembly’ to discuss the issue of headmen."

1926,Police remain mute as Cong goons disrupt ST circulation in Garo Hills,"Sunday, May 10, 2015","Tura: The claims of the Youth Congress to only boycott The Shillong Times in Garo Hills turned out to be more of a forced ban in Tura as a group of unruly party workers led by youth president Richard Marak converged outside the office of the daily on Saturday morning and refused to allow the circulation and threatened readers and paper hawkers.
The worst part was that the police remained onlookers even after they came to know about the incident.
A handful of youth congress workers led by Marak refused to allow the hawkers to distribute the newspaper and even went to the extent of tearing the paper covers to check the contents inside even as a posse of policemen watched on at Ringrey on Saturday morning.
The Congress workers did not allow any paper distribution agent to circulate the daily and sent back the agents with the paper back to the office.
The youth congress has claimed that The Shillong Times provides stale news and needs to be boycotted (read ban).
Interestingly, the youth congress led by Marak has failed to provide a single instance or example of delayed news in the Garo Hills.
Meanwhile, some readers have defied the ban on the paper by walking into the office to get their copies.
The principal of Sherwood School, a renowned educational institute in Garo Hills, refused to accept any forcible ban of the paper.
Principal Tyrone D’Brass, who subscribes 25 copies of The Shillong Times for his school refused to accept the ban and walked away with his daily subscription despite the ban by the youth congress.
“I do not subscribe to forced bans and boycotts. We are living in a democracy. Write what you want and read what you want,” said D’Brass while expressing shock over the restriction to the sale of a paper by a political party which encourages democracy.
“It is the prerogative of the reader to decide which paper he wants to read and subscribe. You cannot force anyone to stop his freedom of speech and expression” said the Sherwood school principal and a state awardee for environmental protection and education."

1939,"More arrests soon, State police hints","Saturday, May 9, 2015","SHILLONG: A day after the arrest of KSU president Daniel Khyriem, police have hinted arrest of more leaders of pressure groups for the varied pending criminal cases under the Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO) Act during their agitations demanding ILP in 2013.
Police have deployed additional security forces following   sporadic cases of arson reported in parts of the State on Thursday and Friday.
East Khasi Hills SP M. Kharkrang told reporters on Friday that there are some more bailable warrants of arrest issued by the special court dealing with the case which will be executed soon.
Kharkrang said as many 87 criminal cases were registered against the leaders of various pressure groups and bailable warrants of arrest were issued by the court following the filing of cases under MMPO Act during their agitation demanding the implementation of ILP in the State.
The SP said that out of the 87 cases registered, charge sheets were filed in 82 cases in the court dealing with the MMPO cases. As many as 80 members of various pressure groups  were arrested in the past in connection with the case, but all of them have secured bail, he said.
A Government lawyer dealing with the matter said that the cases under MMPO Act were different from the civil case of damage suit of over Rs. 31 crore pending before the special court. The damage suit was filed for the damages incurred during the ILP related agitations.
He, however, said that the same special court is dealing with both MMPO cases which are criminal in nature and the damage suit which is civil in nature.
The cases registered under MMPO are under various sections dealing with arson, criminal intimidation, damage of property, criminal conspiracy, murder and abetment, among others, which took place during the four-month-long agitations sponsored by the pro-ILP groups.
Police also clarified that several summons and warrants were issued to the KSU president at his residence in the past, but neither he nor his relatives received them.
Later on Thursday, the bailable warrant of arrest was issued when he was at Sadar police station and subsequently he was arrested after he refused the warrant, police added.
Police registered as many as seven cases against the KSU chief under MMPO.
According to East Khasi Hills SP, the action of the police was as per the direction of the court. The status of the execution of the bailable warrant of arrest issued by the court was reported to the court, the police official said, adding that the court had also fixed a date for police to reply on the cases.
While stating that the cases of arsons were linked to the arrest of the KSU leader, Kharkrang said that security had been beefed up and additional forces deployed in vulnerable areas.
Police, however, are yet to make any arrest following Thursday’s incidents of hurling of petrol bomb at a shop in Polo and torching of a government vehicle in the city."
1940,State Govt free to hold GHADC polls: MHA,"Saturday, May 9, 2015","SHILLONG: In a huge setback to the Congress led MUA-II government, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has asked the former to delink amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and holding of elections in the GHADC.
The State Government had kept on hold the elections to GHADC harping on amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution to increase the seats in GHADC to 40 from the current 30.
Speaking to The Shillong Times over phone on Friday, Shambu Singh, Joint Secretary in charge Northeast, Ministry of Home Affairs, said that the State Government is free to hold elections to GHADC any time.
According to Singh, the amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution will take more time and hence this should not be linked to holding of elections to the GHADC.
The need to delink amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution and holding of elections was conveyed to senior government and police officials during their meeting with Singh in Delhi on Thursday.
Top leaders of ANVC and ANVC-B were also present during the meeting.
According to Singh, if the State Government wants, an official letter from MHA would be sent stressing the need to delink holding of GHADC elections and amending the Constitution.
It was on January 6 this year that the State Cabinet extended the tenure of the GHADC yet again with effect from February 17 stating that  amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution will be carried out by the Centre soon.
Earlier, after the term of the GHADC ended on February 17 last year, the Government instead of holding elections, extended the tenure for six months for the first time stating that the State government wanted to complete the signing of the final peace pact with ANVC and ANVC-B.
Again in August last year, the State government extended the term of the GHADC for another six months to ensure increase in the seats from the present 30 to 40 in the District Council to enable the cadres of ANVC-ANVC-B to take part in elections.
However, in December last year, the term of GHADC was again extended for a month for the preparation of the Government for holding elections to GHADC.
In a change of stand, the State Government again extended the tenure of GHADC with effect from February 17 this year which will end in August.
The State Government was expecting amendment to the Constitution during the Budget session of Parliament in March, but in vain.
During the Assembly session held in March last, District Council Affairs Minister H.D.R. Lyngdoh had defended extension of the tenure of the GHADC by claiming that the Government was adhering to the letter of request sent by the Ministry of Home Affairs to wait for the amendment to Constitution to hold the elections."

Reacting to the 48-hour ultimatum issued by the consortium of pro-ILP pressure groups to the government to release KSU president Daniel Khyriem unconditionally and to drop all cases against them, the government on Friday said it has a clear intent of dealing with the situation legally and added that the Government’s exercise will be embarked by legal perspective.
Informing that several pertinent issues had been discussed during a meeting on Friday, the government said there is no reason for the   pressure groups to issue ultimatums.
Be it the NGOs or political parties, they should desist from issuing any ultimatums since it does not do anything to the State, the government said.
The government further pointed out that the issues at hand had remained unsolved for years and it was unfair on the part of the political parties to ask the State Government to solve the issues immediately.
Meanwhile, referring to Friday’s meeting, the Government said that allowing traditional institutions for the development works of the government is the legislative responsibility of the State legislature and for this the government has to seek the mandate of the legislature.
Mentioning that the Assembly was not in session, the government said it was working on an ordinance to this effect. A detailed discussion on the ordinance  will be held during the Cabinet meeting scheduled on Monday.
The government further said that it was clear on maintaining its legislative responsibilities and limits without infringing into the domain of the autonomous district councils as per the provisions of the Constitution.
In addition to the proposed ordinance, the State government has already constituted a committee led by former Chief Minister D.D. Lapang which has been tasked with listing various ideas to empower the traditional institutions of the State."

1955,CCIB reiterates opposition to Indo-Bangla land swap deal,"Saturday, May 9, 2015","NONGPOH: Registering their strong resentment and opposition over the proposed implementation of Indo- Bangla Land Swap Deal for the proper demarcation of boundary pillar as per Indo – Bangla Land Swap Deal, being signed by the then India Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2011, the Co-ordination Committee on International Border (CCIB) on Friday opposed and also posed claims that the boundary pillar (demarcation Line) as per the land swap deal is totally incorrect.
The CCIB is a conglomeration of the frontal social organizations of Meghalaya comprising Khasi Students’ Union (KSU), Federation of Khasi Jaintia & Garo People (FKJGP), Hynniewtrep National Youth Front (HNYF), FWMWJ, the traditional chiefs and land owners of the Indo-Bangla border (Meghalaya Sector).
Opposing the Indo-Bangla land swap deal for resolving the permanent boundary pillar between India and Bangladesh, the leaders of the CCIB took up the matter with Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju seeking immediate action and appealing to him to take up the matter with the Union Cabinet to exclude Meghalaya in the land swap deal.
According to the memorandum submit to Rijiju, CCIB informed that the land swap deal signed by Manmohan Singh and Sheikh Hasina has been taking up without informing or consulting the traditional heads, village and land owners, which will lead to huge loss of land if the boundary pillar will be settle as per the land swap deal 2011.
“CCIB cannot accept the land swap deal because the total land under the adverse possession from Pillar No 1251 till 1299 in Meghalaya Sector is 559.7 acres, if 240.5 acres come to Meghalaya and 41.7 acres to Bangladesh, what about the remaining 278 acres of land which had not been shown in the report,” CCIB stated."

“We will resort to agitation if Government fails to drop all cases within 48 hours,” FKJGP president Joe Marwein told newsmen after a meeting with the state government on Thursday night.
He said that the pressure groups would meet on Monday to decide their future course of action.
When asked if there was any commitment on the part of the State Government during the meeting to drop the pending cases, he replied in negative.
“But we will not meet the Government again unless it positively responds to our demands,” Marwein asserted.
While terming the arrest of KSU president as unfortunate, he said that the Government has betrayed the pressure groups since it had assured in July last year that it would drop all cases as far as Rs 31 crore damage suit is concerned.
Meanwhile, he also asserted that the State Government should take immediate steps on the implementation of the comprehensive mechanisms to address the issue of influx as suggested by the pressure groups.  The government had filed the suit in the special court of Rithelda Rymbai, seeking compensation of Rs 31,09,50,158 from the groups for the damages and loss of private property, both individual and community-owned, and government property caused during the ILP agitation.

While condemning the arrest, HSPDP vice president Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit said that the Government has taken a U-turn on its commitment to drop all cases against the leaders of pressure groups after they had scaled down on their demand for implementation of the ILP."

Though there was improvement this year in the overall percentage with 75.68 for Science and 72.32 for Commerce as compared to the last five years, there is nothing to cheer about in Garo Hills as far as the results are concerned.
When asked about the reason for the poor performance of candidates from Garo Hills in the HSSLC results in both Science and Commerce streams, Marak said the result was expected as the candidates from Garo Hills, as is often seen, did not have the determination to succeed as much as their counterparts in Khasi Hills.
She said that the candidates from Garo Hills were ‘lazy’ and this was the reason why the result turned out the way it did.
The break-up of district wise percentage of pass in Science stream in Garo Hills is South West Garo Hills (nil) South Garo Hills (nil though three candidates appeared), North Garo Hills (37.50%), East Garo Hills (57.89%), and West Garo Hills (64.22%).
The percentage in other districts is West Khasi Hills (79.37%), East Khasi Hills (78.66%), Ri Bhoi (75.68%), South West Khasi Hills (56.14%), West Jaintia Hills (80.25%), and East Jaintia Hills (72.22%).
In Commerce stream, the pass percentage is South West Garo Hills (nil) South Garo Hills (nil), North Garo Hills,(100%), East Garo Hills (100%),    and West Garo Hills (58.09).

However, with regard to only 3 candidates appearing in the Science stream in South Garo Hills, she said without elaborating that there were only 3 candidates appeared and they too failed.
Meanwhile, another official of MBOSE informed that there were no Science candidates this year from South West Garo Hills as a Science college in the district started functioning  recently only.

1975,Parliament approves bill to settle 41-year-old border issue with B’desh,"Friday, May 8, 2015","New Delhi: Settling the country’s 41-year-old border issue with Bangladesh, Parliament on Thursday unanimously passed a historic bill to operationalise the Land Boundary Agreement that provides for exchange of territories.
The Lower House, showing rare unanimity, passed the Constitution (119th Amendment) Bill to allow the operationalisation of the 1974 India-Bangladesh Land Boundary agreement.
All the 331 members present in the House voted for the bill which became the 100th Constitutional amendment passed by Parliament.
Soon after the passage, Prime Minister Narendra Modi walked up to the Opposition benches to thank leaders including Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, BJD’s B Mahtab, TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay and AIADMK leader P Venugopal.
The deadlock over the bill had ended earlier with the BJP-led NDA Government placing the bill in original form which included Assam, one of the major states.
Earlier, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said it was beneficial for both the countries and that there will a “notional” loss of territory without borders getting contracted.
Once the Indo-Bangladesh border gets redrawn, India will transfer 111 enclaves measuring 17,160.63 acres to Bangladesh and receive 51 enclaves measuring 7,110.2 acres. As far as Assam is concerned, India will be getting 470 acres of land from the neighbouring country, while 268 acres would go to Bangladesh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said in the parliament.
Swaraj said 80 per cent of India’s border with Bangladesh is demarcated and fenced, and once the Land Boundary Agreement is implemented, the remaining part of the border will also be defined and will eventually help in stopping illegal migration.
“A solution to the problem of illegal immigration is inherent in this legislation. With the land border now being decided (with the passage of the bill), the portions where there is no fencing will also get fenced,” she said.
Swaraj said the only issue which remained to be settled with Bangladesh was that of river water-sharing, primarily relating to Teesta river. “The way in which we are now settling the land boundary issue, we will try to settle this issue also.”
The maritime boundary between India and Bangladesh has also been settled last year with the award by the international tribunal.
Refuting allegations about India’s alleged ‘big brotherly’ attitude, the External Affairs Minister said “one is ‘big brother’ which symbolises arrogance. But there is also the ‘elder brother’ who is caring. Ours is a caring attitude. India will maintain the attitude of the ‘elder brother’ with our neighbours.”
She also announced a package of Rs 3,008 crore to West Bengal for rehabilitation of Indian nationals who will come from Bangladesh, with their numbers estimated to go up to 30,000.
Of this amount, Rs 775 crore is for expenses on fixed infrastructure and the remaining amount would be for variable expenses, depending upon how many people are to be rehabilitated by the state government.
Swaraj, in her speech, also referred to the Indira Gandhi-Mujibur Rahman Land Boundary Agreement of 1974 and the historic protocol signed between former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Bangladesh President Sheikh Hasina in September 2011 paving the way for elimination of Bangladeshi and Indian territorial enclaves.
Observing that she has been “transparent” in stating that her party BJP was earlier opposed to the bill, the Minister said it was primarily because of concerns that Assam’s interests would be adveresely affected. However, she said Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, who had earlier expressed some reservations on similar lines, wrote to the Prime Minister and her, urging the Centre to include the clauses relating to the state.
AIUDF’s Sirajuddin Ajmal had reservations over the bill but Swaraj appealed to him to see that it is passed “without a single yellow button (which indicates abstention vote) being pressed.”
Referring to the unanimous passage of the bill by Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, the External Affairs Minister said “this has sent a message to Bangladesh that political parties in India do not have divergent views. The unity which was witnessed in the Rajya Sabha, if the same will be seen in the Lok Sabha then a very good message will be sent to Bangladesh.” (PTI with inputs from our Delhi Correspondent)"

It said that the harsh action being taken by the police had created an atmosphere of concern in the minds of the people which had become a threat to the peaceful co-existence of the public and police personnel.
The GSU, in a statement issued here, pointed out that while the people of Garo Hills welcome and appreciate the profuse efforts taken by the police to perform their duties even at risk to their own lives the unethical tactics being used by some personnel was a cause for concern which had left plenty of scars in the otherwise amicable police-public relationship.
The GSU urged the chief minister to look into the present state of affairs in Garo Hills and reminded him of most recent incidents that had created tension in the region including the custodial death of Balsan, atrocities at Dadenggre, alleged fake encounter of four ANVC-B militants, thrashing of youths at Akonggre, Tura, assault of a teenage girl at Tura Circuit House, assault of a teenage boy at Tetengkol and a lawyer at Fancy Valley allegedly by the SP himself, the alleged fake encounter of Sengbath Marak at Oragitok and the most recent assault of a Nokma of Rongmegre, Chokpot along with a school teacher and other innocent people of the area.
The Union stated that the indifferent silence of the government on these issues was distressing and unacceptable and urged it to take immediate action against those police personnel involved in the atrocities.

Pangniang, on Thursday slammed M/S Agarwal and Co., for its failure to neither execute the construction work properly nor carry out the renovation work as per the standard norms.
“The work done by M/S Agarwal Co. cannot be termed as black topping but it is rather black painting,” Pangniang alleged, while stating that though the project was meant to construct a wider road from the existing one, the road was neither widened nor even repaired properly.
Interestingly the road was completed barely five months back but has begun to show significant traces of wear out and the road condition is back to the way it was, Pangniang said.
“Many a times due to the very bad condition of the road vehicles have broken down and brought traffic to a stagnant position gravely affecting the movement of commuters.

1985,HNLC ban: Decision on May 15,"Thursday, May 7, 2015","SHILLONG:  The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal will pronounce its judgment on the extension of ban on HNLC on May 15.
Once pronounced, the HNLC is likely to be banned for five years as per the demand of both the State government and Centre.

1986,KHADC served one-week deadline,"Thursday, May 7, 2015","SHILLONG:  The Movement for Indigenous Peoples’ Rights and Livelihood, Meghalaya (MIPRL) has set a week’s deadline to KHADC to issue an Executive Order empowering headmen to issue certificates failing which the MIPRL threatened public agitation.
Farmers and students are worst affected due to the stalemate following the restriction imposed on headmen by  the High Court of Meghalaya as they are not able to avail loans for farming and studies, according to MIPRL.
After a meeting with the KHADC CEM Adelbert Nongrum on Wednesday, the delegation consisting of various headmen, FKJGP, HYC and others led by MIPRL also submitted a memorandum to him giving the deadline of seven days and said that the executive order will enable KHADC to issue residential certificates, other ( certificates, and attestations.
“We are constrained to put a deadline of seven days for issuing  the  Executive Order and if it is not fulfilled  there will be public agitation to fight for the Khasi Jaintia Peoples’ customary and traditional rights of which the KHADC is the custodian”, the MIPRL said.
The MIPRL also said that the Executive Order can be passed under Rule 30 of the District Council rules to empower the headmen to issue certificates to enable the farmers of the state from availing loans under the Kisan Credit Card and other schemes since the certificates of the headmen is an important and integral part of the procedure for obtaining such financial assistance.
“Apart from this, thousands of students are facing problems for their admissions into further studies and the examination process. This constitutes an emergency situation which the provision of Rule 30 can meet in the public interest”, MIPRL said.
Since the Village Administration Bill is still taking a long time for implementation, MIPR said the Executive Order was necessary.
The MIPRL also criticized the demand of regional political parties to issue an ordinance by the State Government which according to the organization is nothing but a surrender of the autonomy of the KHADC since the powers in this regards are vested in it by the sixth schedule to the Constitution of India.
The MIPR said that any delay in empowering the headmen will severely affect the agricultural community of the state at a time when agriculture in the whole of India is going through a crisis resulting in farmers’ suicides and political upheavals.
“It may reach such a dangerous condition where the situation can become unsalvageable resulting in severe unemployment, stagnation of capital creation and economic destruction of the State”, the organization said.
According to MIPRL, the Executive Committee of the KHADC and other Autonomous District Councils have the power to issue the Executive Order based on enabling powers given under Para 3 of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India and the emergency powers empowered by Rule 30 read with Rule 28 of the Autonomous District rules and under the United Khasi Jaintia Appointment and Succession of Chiefs and Headmen Act, 1959 since no rules have been framed under this Act.
The power to issue Executive Order by the Executive Committee of an Autonomous District Council in Meghalaya has been confirmed by various rulings of the Supreme Court of India, the MIPRL added."

Among the host of abandoned or incomplete schemes is the Solid Waste Management project of Rs. 600.16 lakh at Umshangling village and construction of 240 units under the Housing for Urban Poor project of Rs 918.15 lakh at Umbuda village which had been abandoned by the government.
Informing this to The Shillong Times, RBYD&SO president Arnold Syngkli said as per the information sought by the organization from the MUDA under the RTI Act, 2005, it was found that the construction of the housing units entrusted to one contractor Leborlang Lyngdoh who was engaged by the Hindustan Prefabs Ltd. (HPL) had abandoned the project and the company had left the project unattended due to the demand for price escalation made by the contractor.
Construction of the housing units began in August 2011 and the HPL spent an amount of Rs. 372. 56 lakh while the remaining amount of Rs. 545.59 lakh had to be refunded to the Central government since the project could not be completed on time, the organisation stated.
Syngkli further informed that the Solid Waste Management project sanction at Umshaling village at an amount of Rs. 600.16 lakh has been facing tardy progress since the firm M/s Marbaniang Enterprise was dilly dallying on the project.
Quoting the RTI documents, Syngkli informed that the contractor engaged for the job has spend a total amount of Rs. 527.43 lakh but the work is very far from being completed. He also blamed MUDA for not taking to task the concerned contractor for delaying the project.From Our Correspondent"

The collection of royalty of Rs 205 crore will bring some relief to Meghalaya which is reeling under financial crunch, while Rs 70 crore cannot be used for any other purpose than restoration of the environment.
The Government had earlier projected the loss of Rs 600 crore following the NGT ban on rat coal mining.
The next hearing of the NGT is likely to be held in the third week of May to address the plea of Commercial Truck Owners and Operators Association (MCTOOA) against payment towards Meghalaya Environment Protection Fund and also the demand of the coal mine owners and dealers to extend the time for further transportation of already extracted coal.

However, the royalty of Rs 205 collected from the extracted coal will be available with the mining department.
The NGT wanted Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund to be used for restoration of environment affected due to the reckless rat hole mining.
Mukherjee said that though the date fixed by NGT for the next hearing is May 14, he would seek extension till May 21 since he has received many applications regarding the case.
He also said if there are applicants demanding the extension of date for transportation of extracted coal, the matter can be taken with NGT."

2011,State without full-fledged Guv for 4 months,"Wednesday, May 6, 2015","SHILLONG: Meghalaya, which is beset with internal issues, is running without a full-fledged Governor for almost four months.
It was on January 6 this year that Keshari Nath Tripathi was sworn in as the Governor of Meghalaya besides holding the additional posts in West Bengal and Bihar.
Later, on April 4 Tripathi was sworn-in as the Governor of Mizoram.
The issues confronting the state include the fall out of the High Court ruling on headmen, Cabinet decision to impose Administrator’s rule in KHADC, the extension of tenure of GHADC and the worsening law and order problem in Garo Hills.
While the State Government is yet to fully address these issues, the long absence of Tripathi, who also looks after three states-West Bengal, Bihar  and Mizoram has added to the problem as the aggrieved parties are unable to meet him.
The Governor is the constitutional head of the state, but the post has also been politicized with BJP-led NDA removing those Governors appointed by the previous Congress-led UPA Government.
K K Paul, who was appointed as Meghalaya Governor by the erstwhile Congress-led UPA Government, was transferred and posted as Governor of Uttarakhand, and subsequently Tripathi got the Meghalaya assignment in addition to other states .
Paul’s tenure as Meghalaya Governor was from July 1, 2013 to January 6, 2015, just one and half years. Commenting on the current situation, former Deputy Chief Minister and United Democratic Party leader Bindo Lanong said that the trend of appointing one Governor for more than one state is not practical.
He also alleged that Meghalaya is being given step motherly treatment by the Centre as for so many months the State is without a full-fledged Governor.
“If an officer goes on leave, someone else can do his job, but no one else can do the job of a Governor,” Lanong, said while adding that the earlier practice of appointing one Governor for one state was good enough.
“Everybody is missing in the State at the moment,” Lanong said in a lighter vain as earlier there were reports of long absence of the Chief Minister.
Echoing similar views, the convener of Mait Shaprang Movement and RTI activist, Michael Syiem  said that the Governor has to look into proper governance and administration of the State as there are so many issues confronting the State which require immediate attention of the Governor.
“We should have a full fledged Governor in the state at the earliest,” he said.
The political parties, pressure groups and others in the State are eagerly waiting for an audience with the Governor following the High Court ruling on headman and also to air concerns over the “arbitrary extension” of the term of GHADC and the cabinet decision to impose Administrator’s rule in KHADC.
The last time Tripathi visited Meghalaya was during the budget session to address the House on March 9.  On the same day, both the Government and the Opposition had met the Governor separately making claims and counter claims regarding the political crisis in the KHADC"

2014,PDF accuses ARPA partners of taking political mileage,"Wednesday, May 6, 2015","HC ruling on traditional heads
SHILLONG: The Congress-led Opposition alliance in the KHADC- People’s Democratic Front (PDF)-has accused the alliance partners of ARPA-HSPDP and KHNAM–  of trying to take political mileage out of the High Court ruling on Rangbah Shnong.
“It is surprising to see the HSPDP and KHNAM deciding to raise the issue separately despite being under the umbrella of ARPA. It seems the two parties are trying to outscore each other by raising the issue individually. Both parties want to take credit if the issue gets resolved finally,” PDF chairman, Pynshngain N Syiem said here on Tuesday.
Syiem further said that while the HSPDP was demanding the formulation of a State law to empower the traditional heads, the KHNAM on the other hand has warned the Government not to intrude into the jurisdiction of the district councils by coming up with such a law.
“It is really funny to see the two parties of the ruling coalition taking different stands on the same issue. This clearly reflects the lack of understanding between the coalition partners,” Syiem said. The PDF chairman also said that while the HSPDP is convening a public meeting on Wednesday to deliberate on the issue the ARPA is holding a separate public meeting on May 12 to discuss the same matter. “This will definitely give a wrong impression to the general public,” he added."
2015,Dialogue with HNLC: HSPDP unhappy over Govt’s frequent change of stand,"Wednesday, May 6, 2015","SHILLONG: The HSPDP has slammed the State Government for taking a U-turn on its commitment to call the proscribed HNLC for a dialogue.
Taking exception to the attitude of the State Government HSPDP vice president Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit said, “The decision of the government not to engage with the HNLC, despite the fact that the latter has repeatedly expressed its desire to have an unconditional dialogue only shows the lack of sincerity on the part of the government.”
“The claim of the government that the HNLC is presently weak and has few members and hence there is no need to invite them for talk is not acceptable,” he added.
Basaiawmoit felt that the government was betraying the people of the State and  Khasi Hills region in particular by not living up to its commitment made on the floor of the House to bring the HNLC to the negotiating table.
Move to expand MUDA jurisdiction opposed
Basaiawmoit said that the party is also concerned about the notification issued by the government recently in connection with the extension of areas under the jurisdiction of MUDA.
“We fail to understand as to why the government wants to rush through this exercise. As a party we don’t any urgent need to bring more areas under MUDA,” he said.
According to him, the State Government should first provide all the basic amenities to the people in those areas.
“Looking at the present living conditions of the people in areas outside municipality we feel that the decision of the government in this regard is uncalled for. We fully understand that there is a need to ensure that construction of houses and buildings must be allowed only after fulfilling the criteria and norms laid down in the Meghalaya building bye-laws. However, the party feels that there are other methods to implement it,” the HSPDP vice president said.
The HSPDP asked the Government to keep in abeyance the order of MUDA."

2023,Alleged abduction by woman: Police launch investigation,"Wednesday, May 6, 2015","SHILLONG: The police have started investigation into an alleged abduction case against Rosita Lyngdoh Nongbri despite her denying all allegations. The complaint was filed by one Elizabeth Rynjah on May 2 whereby Nongbri was accused of abducting her daughter from Lumshyiap and forcing her to sign some papers.
“We have already started our investigation on the matter. We will know who is on the wrong once we complete the investigation,” East Khasi Hills SP M Kharkrang said here on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a day after Nongbri claimed of being wrongly framed, Rynjah came up with a rather different version accusing Nongbri of threatening to kill her.
As per the statements of the three debtors identified as Elizabeth Rynjah, Babita Nongrum and Jenny Malngiang, they had borrowed Rs. 30,000, 70,000 and 1 lakh respectively from Nongbri at an interest rate 30 per cent of the principal amount. However, on nonpayment of the amount borrowed, Nongbri as well as her sister identified as Renu Nongbri, harassed and even threatened to kill Rynjah, took away the belongings of Babita and also made Jenny work in their house without payment.
Nongbri had also accused CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing of borrowing money from her in 2007 and alleged that because she did not receive the money, Kharshiing was quick to draw conclusions and get involved in the matter. Countering these charges, Kharshiing on Tuesday brushed aside the allegations while stating that she took up the cause of the borrowers following the alleged atrocities committed against them by the loan sharks.
“Firstly, this form of money lending with a high interest rate and without proper verification and witness is illegal as it would give ample opportunities to the loan sharks to put pressure on the borrowers. As per the clause of RBI, private money lenders can lend money with only 3 per cent as interest rate,” she said."

2025,"Court silent on Deborah, Tennydard case","Tuesday, May 5, 2015","SHILLONG: After the euphoria over the chargesheet filed against cabinet minister Deborah Marak and political activist Tennydard Marak almost six months ago by police for their alleged links with GNLA, the matter now is in limbo.
Police had field chargesheet against the duo on November 3 last year based on the FIR lodged by political rival of  Deborah, Jonathone Sangma in February 2013 .
The FIR, however, did not name either Deborah or Tennydard, but pointed out the activities of GNLA during Assembly elections in Williamnagar. Police included their names only during the course of investigation.  Both Deborah and Jonathone had secured bail on November 14 last.
The FIR lodged  by Independent  candidate Jonathone  before  the officer in charge of Williamnagar police station on February 16, 2013  said that an open and serious criminal intimidation was meted out to the voters of Williamnagar by way of dropping huge number of   printed threats at different  points in and around Willliamnagar Town  on the night of February 15.
The complainant while furnishing the copies of the printed threats also said that the criminal action by the vested culprits is totally against the election code of conduct and added that it was against the holding of an election in a free, fair and peaceful manner
However, sources said that  the Election Commission did not find anything wrong in the election process.
According to sources, it was on November 26 that the last hearing was held before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Williamnagar on a plea of the police to conduct the proceedings of case related to charge-sheet ‘in camera’. Police also wanted concealment of the names of the witnesses. The lawyers of  Tennydard and Deborah had raised objection to this.
The Court, had reserved the judgment in this regard for December 1.
Sources said that till date, the Court is yet to give its verdict on the plea of the police to have ‘in camera’ proceedings.
Earlier, questions were raised on how independent and authentic were the witnesses in the police charge sheet case as the police merely based their findings on printed pamphlets and the statement of some witnesses.
Other than the seized printed pamphlets which had asked the voters not to vote for Independent candidate Jonathone  and statements of those who submitted the pamphlets and other witnesses   both before the police and magistrate , there are not many material evidences in the chargesheet filed  against Deborah  and Tennydard  submitted by the  Investigation Officer in the court, sources added.
Ironically, as per sources, both the former DGP PJP Hanaman and the Home Minister Roshan Warjri were in the dark when the chargesheet was submitted to the Court by the police."

2029,W’nagar jailbreak: No action yet,"Tuesday, May 5, 2015","SHILLONG: Despite a previous magisterial inquiry headed by   MK  Marak, former Additional District Magistrate, Williamnagar, suggesting security preparedness following the killing of two jailors in Williamanagar jail on February 2, 2013 by unidentified militants, the Government had ignored the suggestions resulting in the jailbreak of May 3 from Williamnagar jail.
Even after the escape of six prisoners including GNLA, ASAK cadres and a convicted rapist from the Williamnagar jail on Sunday, no action  has been taken against the jail staff for the laxity.
One of the suggestions of the magisterial inquiry report into the February 2, 2013 incident, a copy of which is available with The Shillong Times, said that security preparedness was paramount. “One platoon of Homeguards for jail duties and sufficient strength of armed personnel to man all the important entry points and covering round the clock duties is necessary”, the report said.
On February 2, 2013, Assistant Jailor Neil Warjri and warden,  Sarai Singh Thabah were killed when militants stormed the Williamnagar jail premises.
Another suggestion of the inquiry report was to equip the security personnel with latest arms and ammunition.
Moreover, proper infra-structure to secure the personnel on duty as per the Standard Operation Procedures of jail Manual such as barricades, sand bags, towers and others were also stressed upon.
The probe highlighted that “installation of latest gadgets or appliances like siren, CCTV, flood lights and others cannot be compromised”
According to the report, building design of jail administrative block needs to be relooked and basic safety measures to the security requirements need to be re-installed.
“Second boundary wall needs to be erected besides blocking the open spaces all along the walls” the report said.
Frequent patrolling in and around jail premises or relocation of police outpost near the district jail premises, was another suggestion."
2030,State witnesses 32 jailbreaks since 1989,"Tuesday, May 5, 2015","SHILLONG: 32 jailbreaks since 1989 in Meghalaya with the latest being the escape of six prisoners from Williamnagar jail, reveal the recurring crime sans preventive steps.
Sources on Monday said that the jail breaks in the past had resulted in militants re-grouping, and an example in this regard was the revival of HNLC and ANVC previously ALMA after the infamous prison break of August 8, 1995.
Top Meghalaya rebel leaders – Dilash Marak and Jerome Ch Momin of the A’chik Liberation Matgrik Army (ALMA) and HNLC leaders Cheristarfield Thangkhiew and Bobby Marwein along with two rebels of the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland escaped from Shillong jail in 1995. Dilash Marak and Jerome Momin formed ANVC in the same year.  Their escape also resulted in the revival of these two groups and the spurt in violent activities for long.
However, the maximum number of prisoners escaped was in December 26, 2001 as all the 32 prisoners walked out of Williamnagar jail.
Another daring jail break in the recent memory was that of the May 31, 2009 Shillong jail break.
Seven inmates of Shillong jail led by gang leader Fullmoon Dhar effected the jail break after firing in the air in 2009, but Dhar was later shot dead while others were re-captured.
Half a dozen probes related to Shillong jail break had revealed that the jail staff and under trials were in collusion and liquor, money, cell phones and weapons were smuggled into the jail resulting in the escape of under trials.
In August 2013, self styled commander of GNLA Kennedy Sangma, who was under MPDA, escaped from Tura jail after cutting iron bars of ward No III of the jail.
He re-joined the militant group and is yet to be re-captured by the police.
Sources said that plenty of suggestions and corrective measures were given by the probe panels to increase security in prisons in State following these incidents, but in vain as there is no end to prison breaks in Meghalaya."
2031,Schools making a mockery of mid day meal scheme,"Tuesday, May 5, 2015","SHILLONG: Despite the allocation of funds to the tune of Rs 88.55 crore for the mid day meal scheme in Meghalaya during the last fiscal, the implementation of the scheme in schools across the State remains extremely discouraging thanks to the failure on the part of the State Education department.
As per available information, majority of the schools are not implementing the mid day meal scheme. Instead, funds under the scheme are being diverted for other purposes by the schools.
It has been learnt that the schools have been able to divert funds since the Education department does not have enough manpower to properly monitor the implementation of the scheme.
During the financial year 2014-15 the State government had approved 11,227 schools in the State for the mid day meal scheme. Government-managed schools, adhoc and deficit schools qualified for the mid day meal scheme under which approximately 5.14 lakh school children are supposed to get free mid day meals.
Education department projects a bigger sum for current fiscal
Despite the near non-implementation of the mid day meal scheme in schools across the State, the Education department has placed a projection of Rs 107.98 crore as expenditure for the mid day meal scheme for the 2015-16 fiscal.
Mid day meal scheme state nodal officer Akash Deep said that the department with the skeletal manpower at its disposal is doing all it can to monitor the implementation of the scheme.
According to him, shortage of manpower is the prime reason behind the inability of the department to properly monitor the implementation of the scheme.
“From the district to the block levels, the officials involved in the monitoring of the scheme are already overburdened by other responsibilities,” Akash Deep said adding that the officials have been asked to monitor at least 10 schools in their respective areas.
Monitoring teams taking state nodal officer for a ride?
Interestingly, none of the monitoring teams of the Sducation department at the district and block levels have reported to the state nodal officer either about the tardy or complete non-implementation of the mid day meal scheme in schools though it is an open secret that primary and upper primary school students do not get the free food provided by the government.
The government provides food grains like rice through the deputy commissioner (supply) to the schools and for other items like dal, vegetables, edible oil, cooking cost etc., money is given.
Schools that are implementing the mid day meal scheme are supposed to display the meal that is being served daily on a board. However, none of the schools follow this direction as they do not serve the mid day meal.
One of the teachers said on condition of anonymity that her school does not provide mid day meal to the students despite being a beneficiary of the scheme. According to her, the rice that the school gets is diverted to the school hostel, while the hostel cook is given the Rs 1000 under the scheme and the money given to buy other food items apparently goes missing.
The story is no different in most other schools.
Akash Deep said that he has not received any such reports from any of the officers. He, however, assured that soon the state will have dedicated teams whose job will be to monitor the implementation of the mid day meal scheme in the schools.
He also assured that action will be taken against any school that fails to provide meal under the scheme."

2045,Alert cop prevents other prisoners from escaping,"Monday, May 4, 2015","Tura: The sensational jail break by half a dozen prisoners in broad daylight on a lazy Sunday afternoon was made possible due to the absence of armed police personnel manning the outer perimeter of the prison, it is learnt.
Highly placed sources from the prison department reveal that the time when the escape took place the armed police battalion personnel were on ‘off-duty’ outside the prison premises.
The Shillong Times has learnt that the armed police personnel manning the main front gate are releaved of their duties from 12 noon to 3 PM to give them time for relaxation since they have to return to work three hours later which then stretches well into the night and the next morning.
During the three hour break time the unarmed prison guards perform the security duty, it is learned.
The prisoners who planned the break are believed to have been aware of the system in place.
To make matters worse, they took advantage of the games period in the afternoon to launch their operation.
Jail authorities reveal that one of the prisoners approached the temporary assistant warden on the other end of the security gate for the volleyball game set.
When the gate was opened to handover the ball and net, five other prisoners waiting nearby rushed out and reportedly overpowered the warden and came out of the  premises taking advantage of the outer gate which had also been left open and unattended.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that more convicts and prisoners tried to emulate their six comrades who fled to freedom but their attempts were cut short thanks to the quick response by an alert battalion constable on armed duty in a watch tower above the prison.
When the unarmed off duty policemen were trying to halt the escape of the six prisoners outside the jail premises leading to a fist fight, a lone battalion constable on duty in the watch tower spotted the scuffle taking place below.
The constable, who was unable to open fire for fear of hitting one of his own men during the struggle immediately pushed the alarm button to alert the others.
He reportedly rushed down from the tower into the prison compound and confronted another group of ‘enthusiastic’ and ‘wannabe’ escapees pointing his service rifle in their direction and deterring them from taking the leap until additional help arrived."

2047,Delay in disposal of cases: Judges overburdened,"Monday, May 4, 2015","SHILLONG: The district court in East Khasi Hills is burdened with pending cases and this is mounting as the number of cases disposed of every year is far less than the number of cases instituted.
Reason is simple: hands of judges are full with additional responsibilities.
While a single Judge handles cases of Special Court NDPS, CBI, CID, Consumer Court, Vigilance Court, Special Court, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, and Motor Vehicle Accidents Tribunal among others, there are also other Judges who are entrusted with multiple tasks.
Admitting the multiple responsibilities of the Judges in the district, the public prosecutor     IC Jha said that the ideal situation should have been to reduce the burden of the Judges.
It was at the end of 2013 that the State Government set up a Special Court to try the arson cases related to ILP agitation. The damage suit in this regard was over Rs 31 crore. But the case has not made much progress.
The Judge of the Special Court dealing with the damage suit is also assistant to DC,  Munsiff,  Judicial Magistrate, and also chairs Special Court,  Meghalaya Maintenance of Public Order (MMPO).
“Moreover, the duties of District Judge and Sessions Judge are not separated as both take up civil and criminal cases. The ideal situation is that District Judge looks after cases of civil nature whereas the Sessions Judge deals with criminal cases,” Jha said.
While the Chief Judicial Magistrate also functions as Assistant to DC, and Principal Judicial Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, two judicial magistrates are also assistants to D C.
In this context, Jha stressed the need of finding out a mechanism to address the issue of pending cases."
2048,No headway in ILP case,"Monday, May 4, 2015","SHILLONG: The State Government is yet to provide the names of witnesses to the public   prosecutor thereby adding to the delay on the damage suit of over Rs 31 crore filed for the loss incurred during ILP related agitations supported by as many as 14 pressure groups.
The public witnesses include the SPs and officers in charge of various police stations among others.
It was one and half years ago that the Government promptly formed a Special Court to deal with the arson cases.  Three persons lost their lives and property worth over Rs 31 crore damaged during the agitation of pressure groups demanding ILP.
A lawyer dealing with the case said on Sunday that unless the law and political departments hand over the list of witnesses related to the case, there will be further delay in the justice delivery.
Earlier, the Special Court had issued non-bailable warrant against the leaders of 12 pressure groups as they had not turned up before the Court, but in vain.
Currently, only two pressure groups, CSWO and All India Garo Union out of the total 14 regularly attend to the court hearing."

2051,40 villages keen to co-host Intl Terra Madre Festival in Nov,"Monday, May 4, 2015","SHILLONG: Representatives of 40 villages from various parts of Meghalaya gathered together at the Meghalaya Basin Development Authority Hall, Shillong, on Saturday as a joint step taken in preparation for the upcoming International Mei-Ramew 2015 to be held in the State in November.
The International Mei-Ramew (also known as Indigenous Terra Madre), is a major milestone hurtling towards NESFAS and all the individuals, communities and partners engaged in various NESFAS activities. This edition of the event, tentatively scheduled between November 3 to 7, will be the second of its kind; the first was held in Jokkmokk, Sweden, in 2011.
The selection of 40 communities, who will participate in the event as co-hosts, was based on their desire to take part in the event, their agreement to fulfill of certain criteria set by NESFAS and their active involvement in the preservation of their local agro-biodiversity.
The gathering, which was facilitated by A.K. Nongkynrih, Head of Department, Sociology, NEHU, was called with an aim to discuss the community’s involvement in the International Mei-Ramew, scheduled programmes prior to the event, committees to be formed and their functions, and communities’ participation and representation.
This coming together of the communities’ representatives would ensure the further collaboration with NESFAS and the final resolution towards the upcoming event. Among the various topics of discussion, was the issue of presentation of their villages to visiting delegates, which is scheduled for the fourth day of the event; a handful of villages will be selected for international and national delegates to visit and experience the local biodiversity.
Chairman NESFAS, Phrang Roy, who was also present at the meeting, while addressing the gathering, pointed out that at the IMR, Meghalaya, will be projected in an international platform with delegates representing Indigenous communities from all over the world participating in the event.
Quoting the African proverb “Until the lion has his or her own storyteller, the hunter will always have the best part of the story”, Roy stressed on the importance of communities playing a major part in the event.
The event should not be portrayed as one that was held for them but one that was held by them.
He urged the communities to put forward their best. He also spoke of the unique aspects of host communities emphasizing on their matrilineal culture and preservation of forests through sacred groves as their major attraction.
Perhaps one of the striking decisions put forward by the participating communities was their desire to act as change agents in the preservation of agro-biodiversity, conserving traditional knowledge and rural empowerment.
Other decisions would cover sustainable development, community well-being and unity and also to showcase their respective cultural prosperity, which would subsequently promote local food.
“Steps have been taken to collaborate the working of NESFAS with the Government in this project,” said Bibhudutta Sahu, Project Director, NESFAS, while congratulating the community members on the work done so far.
“NESFAS will facilitate the Festival while the Government will lend NESFAS and the communities its support. The International Mei-Ramew 2015 will be Meghalaya’s highlight for the year,” he added assertively.
The state level meeting of the same congregation will be held from May 12. The NEHU campus, Shillong, will be the venue for the first three days of the conference while the fourth day will entail visits to some of NESFAS communities for visiting delegates. The event will conclude at the Sacred Groves at Lawkyntang, Mawphlang, in a food festival which will be open to the public."

2055,BJP to organise ‘Congress free Meghalaya’ campaign,"Monday, May 4, 2015","SHILLONG: Buoyed with the enrolment of forty thousand members in Meghalaya, the BJP is now preparing for a ‘Congress free Meghalaya’ campaign in the State.
A statement from the Meghalaya BJP said on Sunday that the party has reached the target of forty thousand members in the State.
“We are soon launching our active membership drive and mass contact programme to reach out to all members who have joined online. Our National President’s successful visit has further motivated our workers,” the state BJP said.
Understanding the growth of the BJP in Meghalaya and the special attention of Modi Government towards the North East, the ruling Congress in Meghalaya has become restless, the BJP statement claimed.
After being defeated in the last general elections and assembly elections in few states in the country, the Congress party in Meghalaya is sensing that the party is losing ground and therefore the Congress leaders are coming from Delhi and getting agitated and are short of words, the BJP pointed out.
“The reason behind Congress party losing ground is the anti- poor policy of the State Government, rampant corruption, lawlessness, and anti- teachers’ policy, among others,” the State BJP said.
According to the BJP, the ruling party in any state usually speaks well of its achievements and lauds its policy but since the ruling party in Meghalaya has no achievements and no good policy to highlight, it is now attacking the BJP.
“Visiting Congress leaders are well aware of the failure of the State Government and hence, to divert attention, they are speaking against the BJP,” the party said.
“The people in the State are well aware of the achievements of Narendra Modi Government in the last one year, (to be completed within few days from now). The people also appreciate that Modi is seriously working to curb corruption throughout the country which, during the Congress regime,    was at its peak and the economy which was in mess during the Congress rule is now back on track,” the state BJP said.
“The Congress party had kept the development of the North East at halt but it is now peaking at a fast pace. The frequent visit of Central Ministers to the State is also becoming a concern for the State Congress leadership because their misdeeds are getting uncovered,” the BJP added."

2067,Ex- MLA misleading people: DC,"Sunday, May 3, 2015","SHILLONG: A day after former legislator of Bajengdoba John Manner Marak made allegation of  misuse of relief funds,  the North Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner W Khyllep said that Marak made the allegation since his wife  projected an amount of Rs 7,72,800 as damage to his properties which is not as per norms.
“The Ex-MLA John Manner Marak through his wife claimed that the damage to his properties was Rs 7, 72,800 and wanted that compensation is to be paid by the Government for this amount. But as per the norms of the Government, he is entitled to get only around Rs 12,600  being a severely damaged pucca house”, Kyllep said.
According to Khyllep, because of “such unreasonable expectations of more financial amount which remain  unfulfilled, the former legislator appears to be upset thereby trying to mislead the people through press statement”.
The official reiterated that relief is not a compensation for the house damaged but it is only an assistance or relief to the affected families.
Khyllep in a statement issued here on Saturday said that   the District Administration, while releasing any relief to the affected households, follow the norms of the Central Government and after due enquiry and verification by the field officers/BDOs, the amount of money as entitled by the affected families as per norms are released accordingly.
According to the Deputy Commissioner, the contents as alleged by the ex-legislator in  The Shillong Times  are  misleading targeting  the BDO and the District Administration.
Khyllep said that their  records and as the report submitted by the BDO, Resubelpara, read with the statements of the concerned Gram Sevak and the beneficiaries are facts which are not reflected in the  news item.
The official also said that the report that the “cash of Rs 75,000 was to be released on Friday” was not true as no physical cash can be distributed to the affected families since all financial assistance for relief are being made through bank accounts according to the orders of the Government and Guidelines of the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF).
“The allegation by the ex-MLA relating to the amount of financial assistance and the rightful beneficiaries is also not based on facts since the amount is according to NDRF norms and the beneficiaries are decided based on the reports received from BDOs, substantiated by documents at the field level, Block Junior Engineers’ Certificates and photographs”, the Deputy Commissioner said.
According to the Deputy Commissioner, ‘it is binding on the BDOs to ensure that genuine beneficiaries are given relief. “The BDOs have no power to change or select any beneficiary at their own sweet will without proper verification and without proper sanction from the District Administration and the Government”, Deputy Commissioner  asserted.
According to the Deputy Commissioner, It is to be noted that the survey for the cyclone that occurred in the month of May, 2014 and landslides and flood that occurred on September 22  for some areas was done by Songsak Development Block which was later forwarded to Resubelpara Development Block following the merging of some villages"

2082,HSPDP asks Govt to hold talks with HNLC,"Saturday, May 2, 2015","Basaiawmoit slams State Govt for backtracking on proposal to invite outfit for peace talks
SHILLONG: The HSPDP has slammed the Meghalaya Government for repeatedly changing its stand on the proposed peace talks with the proscribed Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC).
“We are surprised that the State government is now not keen on any dialogue with the outfit,” HSPDP vice president Ardent Miller Basaiawmoit told newsmen after the party’s Central Executive Committee meeting here on Friday, while terming the government’s latest stand as unjustified.
“If the Government is eager to have a dialogue with a dangerous organization like the GNLA which continues to kill people in Garo Hills, I do not see any difficulty in inviting the HNLC for talks even if they have only five to ten members,” Basaiawmoit said, while adding that the purpose of dialogue is to ensure lasting peace.
Observing that the government should not take any decision based on inputs provided by the police, Basaiawmoit said, “The government should respond positively to any peace offer by any militant outfit. The main objective of a dialogue is to ensure that such militant groups do not resurface again and also to bring the misguided youths back to the mainstream,” he said.
Basaiawmoit also asked the government to avoid any further delay in bringing the HNLC to the negotiation table.
‘Establish law to define powers and functions of Rangbah Shnong’
The HSPDP also urged the State government to come up with a State Law to define the powers and functions of the Rangbah Shnong.
“The Government cannot continue to adopt a dilly dally tactics in addressing this issue. The situation is aggravating especially after the arrest the Sordar of Wahkhen. The Government will have to take concrete steps in addressing the present stalemate at the earliest,” Basaiawmoit said.
“It is very important on the part of the State Government to bail out the Rangbah Shnong and Dorbar Shnong by formulating a State law to define their powers and functions,” he said.
He blamed the State government for allowing the situation to worsen following the High Court ruling.
“The Government continues to overlook the bills passed by the KHADC from time to time. The Council had come up with the Village Administration Bill, 2014 to define the powers and functions of the Rangbah Shnong which was rejected by the Government,” Basaiawmoit said.
Basaiawmoit further informed that the HSPDP will convene a meeting of the Rangbah Shnong and other traditional heads of Khasi and Jaintia Hills at Khasi National Durbar Hall on Monday noon to chalk out the strategy to deal with the current situation.
HSPDP threatens to protest against MUDA expansion
The HSPDP also condemned the Meghalaya Urban Development Authority for trying to expand its jurisdiction in areas outside the Shillong Municipality.
“We strongly object to any attempt by the MUDA to expand its jurisdiction,” Basaiawmoit said, while asking the State government not to allow MUDA to continue with this exercise.
The HSPDP leader threatened to launch a strong protest if the exercise continued.
Meanwhile, the HSPDP vice president informed that a party delegation will go to New Delhi to express their opposition to the proposed Land Acquisition Bill.
“We will submit our representation to various Central leaders to highlight the party’s stand on the proposed land bill,” he added."
2083,"Communal, non-secular BJP has no place in N-E: Oza","Saturday, May 2, 2015","SHILLONG: With the BJP attempting to make inroads in various states of the North East, All India Mahila Congress (AIMC) president Shobha Oza on Friday said the Congress will counter the growing popularity of the BJP in the region by highlighting and create mass awareness on its alleged communal and anti-secular policies.
“Everyone knows that the BJP is a communal and non-secular party. Therefore, the party with such an ideology will not have any place in the North East. The people of the region have always supported secular party like the Congress,” Oza while addressing newsmen here on Friday.
The Mahila Congress will launch agitations to counter and oppose the ideology of the BJP.
She was confident that the BJP would never be able to match the popularity level enjoyed by the Congress in the North Eastern region.
“The negativity and insensitiveness of the BJP towards the people of the region is reflected in its imposition on how people should eat or live,” Oza said.
Speaking on the proposed bill that guarantees 33 per cent reservation for women in parliament and state legislatures, the AIMC president dared the BJP to pass the bill in the Lok Sabha where the party enjoys absolute majority.     “We have a majority in the Rajya Sabha and we will ensure the facilitation of the legislation,” she said.
Earlier, during the meeting, functionaries of the Mahila Committees from across Meghalaya highlighted the financial difficulty besides other problems faced by them before the AIMC president.
Speaking on this, Oza said, “I have instructed the committees here to form self help group to empower the women folk.”
She also informed that the party would start a mahila membership drive soon.
AIMC secretary Shahnaz Haque emphasized on the need for the women to raise their voices against violence and crimes against women.
Referring to the report which states that domestic rape in N-E is quite less since most of the cases were not reported, Haque said, “The Mahila members here should encourage the women to come forward and report such crimes.”
She stressed on the need to educate women in the N-E on the importance of the Congress party at the national level as well as in the region.
The Meghalaya Pradesh Mahila Congress Committee, meanwhile, condemned the promulgation of the Land Acquisition (Ordinance), 2015 by the BJP Government at the Centre, and demanded repeal of the same and adoption and implementation of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.
The MPMCC also resolved to fight to ensure one-third reservation of seats for women in Parliament and State Assemblies.
The Pradesh Mahila Committee also condemned the recent statement of the NDA Government in the Parliament on the issue of marital rape."
2084,‘Opportunities to be created for misguided N-E youths’,"Saturday, May 2, 2015","SHILLONG: In a bid to solve the issue of armed conflicts in the North East region, the Union Home Ministry will create opportunities for misguided youths to come back and join the mainstream.

Asked about the problem being faced by people from the North East in mainland India, he said that opportunities for the people would be created here in the region itself so that people remain engaged in various activities in the region itself.
He said that the Ministry will soon move an amendment in the IPC which speaks about penalty provisions. Every Ministry has been asked to formulate policies to cater to the needs and problem of the Northeastern people, he added.
Reacting to a query about the cases of racism existing in N-E against mainland people, he said that in the country as a whole, there is a need to develop closer relations through provisions of   information and creation of jobs besides inculcating respect and honour for each other.
“Unity has to be imbibed across regions and we have to mingle around with proper policies and programmes. We are committed to that and in few years people can see the difference,” he said."

CoRP’s action follows a statement made by leaders of the nine Dorbar Shnongs in a section of the vernacular dailies against the intervention of the CoRP in the quarry and mining activities undertaken by M/s Dhar Construction Company along the river bank of Umiam at Nonglum Village, Ri Bhoi.
The nine Dorbar Shnongs have been supporting the quarry mining by M/s Dhar Construction Company as they felt it was generating revenue for the village and also helping with developmental works such as construction of roads in the villages.
M/s Dhar Construction Company is owned by Umroi legislator Ngaitlang Dhar.
CoRP issued a 20-day deadline to the KHADC and the office of the Hima Mylliem to conduct spot inspection of Umiam River to assess the damage to environment caused by the quarry activities so that stringent action could be taken against the construction company.
CoRP informed that they had met the KHADC CEM and representative of Hima Mylliem on Tuesday last seeking their immediate action to stop mining activities along the river bank, but to no avail.
CoRP further questioned whether the road construction work undertaken in the nine villages was initiated by the legislator in his capacity as MLA of the areas or as owner of Dhar Construction Company, and demanded clarification on the same.
“If the nine Dorbar Shnongs continue to extend their support to the mining activities despite the wide-spread destruction to the environment, we will be left with no option but to knock the doors of the higher authority of the concerned department,” CoRP added."

The pressure groups held a meeting attended by the UDP legislators and MDCs from Shella and Sohra on Wednesday at Sohra and demanded the removal of the SDO in protest against the manner in which the enrolment drive was carried out.
A government notification issued on Wednesday informed that the SDO has been released on Wednesday from Meghalaya segment to enable him to join Assam segment of the joint cadre with effect from the date of handing over charge.
The Government has directed Nipon Hajong, Extra Assistant Commissioner, to look after the charge of SDO (Civil) Sohra.
Surprisingly, the government notification claims that Dass had been released after the Government of Assam conveyed its willingness to have the officer in the Assam segment in its letter dated March 31.
Earlier, following the disruption of the enrolment drive, the SDO had lodged a complaint at Sohra PS that on April 20 at around 11.35 am, unidentified miscreants (numbering 30-40) with video cameras created nuisance and chased away the people of Ichamati and Shella who were in the SDO (Civil) Office, Sohra to register themselves in the electoral rolls.
The Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the pressure groups   including KSU, FKJGP and Seng Samla Shnong Sohra had given the State Government a week’s deadline to remove the SDO of Sohra.
The JAC took this decision during the public meeting held at Sohra on Wednesday.
Interestingly, the public meeting was also attended by Shella legislator Donkupar Roy, Sohra legislator Titosstarwell Chyne, Shella MDC Teinwell Dkhar and Sohra MDC Donevan Kharwanlang.
While speaking at the meeting, Roy said the people of Sohra need an officer who understands the sentiments of the people.
“May be this officer is too young and is yet to receive proper training to head as an SDO. I have already spoken to the Chief Secretary PBO Warjri to transfer the officer,” he said.
KSU president Daniel Khyriem said that the NGOs were given an assurance by the Government that hearing and verification of new voters would be held at the village level to be assisted by the Dorbar Shnong.

2110,Govt panel remains a non-starter,"Thursday, April 30, 2015","SHILLONG: A jumbo-sized committee formed by the State government to strengthen the traditional institutions has remained a non- starter since its formation in a meeting convened by the State Government on March 4 this year.
The committee consisting of as many as 43 members – headed by Chief Adviser to the Meghalaya government and former Chief Minister DD Lapang – was to submit its report to the Government within 60 days.
The term of the committee is set to expire next week (May 4) without a single meeting being called till date.
It was in the aftermath of the High Court of Meghalaya ruling restricting headmen from issuing various certificates that the State government had deemed it necessary to constitute the committee. The task of the committee was to submit recommendations to empower and institutionalize the traditional institutions.
Former Deputy Chief Minister Bindo Lanong, who is a member of the Committee, on Wednesday, said it was unfortunate that not a single meeting was convened by the Chairman of the panel.
“It appears that the Government is not at all concerned. I had called up Lapang a month ago expressing the need to meet and he had even agreed to convene the meeting, but in vain,” Lanong said.
According to Lanong, various fallouts of the Court ruling could be avoided if there had been proper follow ups.
“Moreover, the Village Administration Bill is still lying with the Government pending approval,” he said.
Earlier, another member of the panel, Toki Blah, had criticized the Government for constituting an ill-represented panel. Blah had spoken against non representation of women and non- indigenous persons in the committee headed by Lapang."

2124,GHADC set for another extension,"Wednesday, April 29, 2015","Amendment to 6th Schedule to be delayed
SHILLONG: The amendment to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution to increase the seats in District Councils will take longer time as yet again amendment has not been listed for the ongoing session of the Parliament..
This has made the decision of the state government to extend the tenure of GHADC futile as the government was waiting for the amendment to hold elections.
According sources, the draft amendment, which is pending with the Union Ministry of Law and Justice, is yet to be vetted by the department.
The re-assembled session in Parliament, which began on April 21, will end on May 8.
The reason the state government cited for the extension of GHADC for another six months since February was that the Centre was ready with the amendment to the sixth schedule to the constitution which will enable the Government to conduct elections in the increased seats of 40 from the current 30.
Earlier too, when the Budget session started last month, the amendment was not listed in the business of the Parliament.
By the time the monsoon session will convened by the Parliament, the extension of six months will almost expire as the validity of the extended GHADC will be till August 17 next.
When contacted, NPP legislator James Sangma said over phone from Delhi that the State Government had repeatedly banked on the amendment to the Sixth Schedule to extend the tenure of GHADC which has turned out to be a lie.
“As far as NPP is concerned, the Chief Minister lied time and again on the issue of extension of  GHADC tenure. Election should be called immediately and we fear that the Government is trying to stall the elections for the personal benefit of the Chief Minister”, James asserted."

“We have got feed backs from several NGOs about attempts by the Union Government to illegally mine the uranium deposits in Khasi Hills. We are on the job to verify if the inputs given by the NGOs are true,” Nongrum said on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, the HYC had set a deadline of one week for the KHADC to act against a company which, according to the group, was engaged in mining uranium in South West Khasi Hills.
Nongrum claimed that there was some ‘hidden agenda’ behind the Centre’s decision to sanction construction of the two-lane Nongstoin-Domiasiat-Mawthabah road at a cost of Rs. 470 crore.
“If the Centre is really concerned about the development of the State then it should have allotted road project in other parts of West Khasi Hills as well. But this two-lane project is definitely connected with the proposed uranium mining,” Nongrum said.
The KHADC CEM recalled that in 2009, the State Government had misled the people and had leased 422 hectares of land in uranium rich West Khasi Hills to Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) for 30 years to undertake the pre-project developmental works.
Nongrum further stated that they will not allow the Centre to mine the uranium at any cost on the ground that it would degrade the environment and precipitate health hazards in and around the mining areas.
“We do not want our people to suffer from various dreadful diseases due to the radiation caused by uranium mining,” he said.
Meanwhile, Mawlai MDC P.T. Sawkmie also said that he will continue to oppose uranium mining in South West Khasi Hills and asked the Atomic Energy department to abandon the project.

The FKJGP also opposed the proposed project.
“As per our information, the Centre has started to initiate the exercise for facilitating uranium mining. We will not allow the Centre to mine the uranium at any cost,” the FKJGP said in a statement."

The committee has taken this decision to go for tree plantation to check unabated pollution caused by various private companies and individuals along the two rivers following a joint inspection conducted in December last year.

According to him, the inquiry conducted by the committee had found out that the pollution of the two rivers is due to earthwork along the stretch of the land belonging to Doris Pyngrope and also the land given to the YFC Company by Honsen Lyngdoh where the crusher is the main cause of pollution on the river.

In reply to RTI questions by The Shillong Times, the State CID said that a total of eight cases were registered till date by the CID ‘s  Anti -Corruption Branch under Prevention of Corruption Act 1998.  Out of the 8 cases, two ended in final report (nothing was proved) and out of this, one case was not followed up due to the death of the accused.
Out of the 8 cases, only four were chargesheeted and the same number of persons were prosecuted. However, their conviction is awaited as the cases are under trial.
While the first case was probed in 1996, the last case registered under the Prevention of Corruption Act was in 2014.
There are concerns about the absence of autonomy of the Anti-Corruption Branch as it is not an independent body.
Police have admitted that the Anti Corruption Branch cannot initiate inquiry on its own.
“The process of  launching an ACB inquiry is that the political department of the State Government initiates direction to the head of ACB to start inquiry and submit findings to the Government”, the reply of the CID official said.
Moreover, “Findings of the Inquiry are submitted to the political department which then decides whether to carry out criminal investigation or not”.
While police maintained that there is no need for the ACB to seek permission from the Chief Secretary  who is the State Vigilance Commissioner, the political department maintained that a vigilance cell has been set up with the Chief Secretary as the State Vigilance Commissioner, who  looks into the complaints of the corruption against any public servant . The political department, however, added that the State Vigilance Commission has not been set up in the State.
Though the RTI reply mentions that there is no State Vigilance Commission, the Meghalaya Government website says that there is a State Vigilance Commission headed by the State Vigilance Commissioner who is appointed by the Governor. “The State Vigilance Commission enjoys the same measure of autonomy as enjoyed by the Meghalaya Public Service Commission. The Vigilance Commission can cause an enquiry or investigation to be made into any complaint or corruption or mis-conduct on the part of a public servant. It may also formulate proposals for the prevention and control of corruption”, says the Meghalaya Government portal under section “About Meghalaya”
A letter of the then Commissioner and Secretary, political department  G.P.Wahlang, addressed to various heads of the department in 2001 said that ” State Anti-Corruption Branch under the control of the Chief Secretary as the State Vigilance Commissioner has been functioning in the Political Department”
According to the letter, all complaints of corruption, and misconduct of public servants which required investigation by the State Anti-Corruption Branch should be referred to the State Vigilance Commissioner by all concerned departments, and officers.
“On the order by the State Vigilance Commissioner, the cases and complaints  will be enquired into by the Anti-Corruption Branch of the State police department under the over-all supervision by the Inspector General of Police (CID)”, the letter said.
Moreover, the direction said that all enquiries and reports by the Anti-Corruption Branch of the state police will be submitted by the Inspector General of Police (CID) to the State Vigilance Commissioner for further necessary action."
2153,21.1 % of households in State are headed by women,"Tuesday, April 28, 2015","SHILLONG: A one-day consultation on “Sexual Reproductive Health & Women’s participation in Policy” organised jointly by the State Resource Centre for Women (SRCW), Public Health Foundation of India and the Meghalaya Institute of Governance (MIG) and supported by DFID was organized on Monday at the MIG premises.
Participants included NGOs, faculty of Social Work Department, St Edmunds College, Voluntary Health Association of Meghalaya (VHAM), officials of the Heath and Social Welfare Department and Basin project officials.
The consultation, jointly moderated by Dr Sandra Albert, a public health expert who heads the PHFI in the region and Ivyreen Warjri, Mission Director, SRCW dealt with   issues of evidence-based policy planning   and effective implementation, the importance of needs assessment in arriving at correct interventions, capacity building of communities, effective training of human resource in Health Department and the criticality of planning, monitoring and evaluation.
Dr Albert pointed out to the unmet needs for contraception in Meghalaya which stands at 35% according to a National Family Health Survey-3 report, which makes it the highest in the country and which resulted in Meghalaya becoming the state with the highest fertility rate.
The workshop saw participants in groups who engaged in interactive sessions, listing out the key issues that hinder women from accessing sexual and reproductive rights and health care and the possible solutions to this challenge.
At the valedictory function, Principal Secretary Planning, and Deputy CEO, Meghalaya Basin Dev Authority, Mr Pankaj Jain while responding to the issues listed as needing intervention, informed the stakeholders that the number of women-headed households in Meghalaya is 21.1% of the total population which makes it the fourth highest (Goa tops the list with 25%) in the country and a challenge for planners in the State.
While emphasising the need to pool data from different sources and therefore come up with the correct needs assessment strategies, Mr Jain, however stated that there is need to move beyond numbers and create the ambience for better informed debate on issues. “In sexual and reproductive rights and health we need to bring change at two levels. First there has to be better access to contraception; secondly, better access to health seeking options” Mr Jain said and hinted at the need to turn the issue into a societal agenda. He, however, cautioned that bringing social change is an intense political process where the ambit for involving different societal actors must constantly expand to create a tipping point.
Mr Jain pointed out that bringing change in women’s conditions is an arduous task. “It involves pushing of boundaries, creating networks and even making compromises so that everyone comes on board. It involves a process of give and take as opposed to rigid stances. The objective of the MIG is to nibble away at the problem and let people think it out for themselves. Change involves different tactics, alliances and techniques and in this there is no place for emotions,” Jain stated.
Pointing to matriliny, Mr Pankaj Jain said this is a social system that has given rise to new problems along with the baggage of the old. “Don’t pitch matriliny as a ‘women’s only’ issue because it impinges on every member of society, male and female,” Mr Jain said, adding that the issue of matriliny requires deconstruction and greater attention to family values.
It may be mentioned that the PHFI has conducted several research projects to better understand the sexual and reproductive health needs not only in Meghalaya but of the entire North Eastern Region."

“It is unimaginable to know that the amount payable by the consumers is up by more than 500 per cent,” Basaiawmoit said in a representation submitted to Power Minster Clement R Marak recently.
He further said that he had raised this issue on several occasions both outside and inside the State Assembly.
“It is very unfortunate that billing system remains unchanged though the authority concerned is fully aware of the problem faced by the consumers. There is a strong suspicion that the corporation is trying to compensate its loss by indirectly and conveniently passing the burden on the consumers,” the Nongkrem legislator said.
Basaiawmoit said that to rub salt into the wounds the concerned corporation further penalise the poor consumers by charging interest if they fail to make payment at a given time."

The Dorbar Shnong said that after noticing the illegal construction, it had convened an executive committee meeting on March 28.
After proper inquiry, it was revealed that the construction was carried out by some individuals who had vested interests, the Dorbar Shnong said, adding that the individuals had voluntarily offered to dismantle the illegal  construction with immediate effect.
The Dorbar Shnong further said that after the individuals concerned failed to dismantle the stalls, another executive committee meeting was held on April 11 and the persons pleaded for a week’s time to dismantle the structures.
Since the individuals failed to fulfill their commitment, the executive committee held one more meeting on April 25 to discuss the matter.
The Dorbar Shnong apprised the Deputy Commissioner that as the vacant road side Government land has become an eyesore, it was proposed to clean the area and convert the plot into a parking lot or open a fish and vegetable market for the hawkers of the area.
The Dorbar Shnong, while thanking the local MLA for providing a scheme to cement and level the area, however,  said that the purpose was not to erect any kind of permanent or semi-permanent structures in the area.
“Since the area was not allotted to anyone, the steps taken by the Dorbar Shnong were necessary to prevent any encroachment to the vacant Government land,” the statement, said, while making an appeal to the Deputy Commissioner to prevent setting up of illegal constructions."

Hundreds of students poured-in at Edufest’15 at All Saints’ Hall and attended the seminar conducted by former Aaj Tak and Headlines Today International editor, Professor Harsh Ranjan. The students were keen to know the functioning of national media, particularly the TV news channels.  Tanya Marngar and Jessica MK Syiemlieh, class 12th students from Pine Mount School wished to become TV news Anchors for national channels while many others opted for reporting.
Professor Harsh Ranjan while elaborating the editorial functioning of TV news channels suggested all students to keep themselves aware of current happenings on every issue.
A true journalist is an avid reader who keeps his eyes and ears open 24×7 and has amazing observation powers, said Prof.  Ranjan while giving tips to the students.
He said that there exists a high potential in North East region media students to take up career with national media but unfortunately their participation so far has been very low. Prof. Ranjan who now heads department of Journalism and Mass Communication of Sharda University observed that more and more media aspirants should come forward for taking stake at national level. This is the only way news from NE region can get respectable space in the national media. The current scene is that national media cover NE region only when there is a tragedy. Even during elections TV news channels hardly sanction any budget for NE region which is a sad state of mind, said Prof. Ranjan.
Praising the efforts of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving thrust on NE region Prof. Ranjan said that the national media must also essentially give at least 10 to 20 percent news coverage from the seven sisters. He urged the students to come up hard and mark their presence forceful on the social media with all kinds of information and news sharing from the NE region. This will not only keep the region live in terms of news but will also help wake up the national media maintained Prof. Ranjan."
2165,NGO reiterates oppn to Uranium mining in State,"Tuesday, April 28, 2015","SHILLONG: The Meghalaya Environment Friendly Students Union (MEFSU) has expressed its stiff opposition to any move to mine uranium in the State.
Calling out to people to not get ‘fooled’ by the promises of the government and the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL), MEFSU president, Rangdajied Marwein claimed that there is no mechanism to completely stop the radioactive contamination resulting from uranium mining.
“Even an advanced country like the USA has not been able to develop such mechanism,” Marwein said here on Monday.
While the pressure groups and opposition parties have expressed stiff opposition to any sort of uranium mining in the state, as many as seven villages in and around the uranium mining sites in West Khasi Hills had last year urged the State Government to go ahead with the mining.
Reiterating its stand on the proposed uranium mining project in West Khasi Hills, the KSU had also opposed the Centre’s decision to go for the two-lane road project connecting the villages of the district which have a large deposit of uranium. The leaders of the union as well as the North East Students’ Organization (NESO) feared that the two-lane project was meant to facilitate uranium mining in the State.
The Centre had sanctioned the two-laning of the 68 km Nongstoin-Domiasiat-Mawthabah road at a cost of Rs 470 crore.
Municipal Board urged to implement plastic ban
The MEFSU, meanwhile urged the Shillong Municipal Board (SMB) to take immediate measures to stop use, sale and stocking of plastic bags measuring 40 micron and below.

2171,Poll officers of N-E states to meet on April 29,"Monday, April 27, 2015","SHILLONG: Chief Electoral Officers of all the eight Northeast states will meet in Shillong on April 29 to discuss the implementation of the National Electoral Roll Purification and Authentication Programme (NERPAP) to bring out a complete error-free and authenticated electoral roll throughout the country.
Meghalaya Chief Electoral Officer P. Naik said on Sunday that Deputy Election Commissioner of India Vinod Zutshi will chair the meeting.
The purpose of the meeting convened by the Election Commission of India is to match the electoral rolls with bio metric records to remove dubious or duplicate voters.
In case of Meghalaya, the task to authenticate bio metric cards is undertaken by the Registrar General of Census.
The new initiative of NERPAP is aimed at proper authentication of the voters as Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC) data of electors will be linked with Aadhaar data.
NERPAP also aims at improving the image quality of electors by way of corrections of  errors as matching with Aadhaar will ensure accuracy of electoral rolls.
As per NERPAP, the facility to link Aadhaar number will be provided to electors through SMSes, e-mails, mobile applications and National Voters Service Portal using web services through ECI website.
NERPAP also suggests that electors also can link their Aadhaar number by making a call at 1950 to states’ call centres.
NERPAP also highlights that collection and feeding of Aadhaar will be done by Electoral Registration Officer. For this, special camps will be organized, besides setting up of voter facilitation centres, e-Seva centres and citizen service centres. Moreover, Booth Level Officers will also conduct door-to-door surveys to collect the details.
Meghalaya with just 0.7 per cent (total 21,313 persons) is at the bottom in terms of availing Aadhaar cards as per the official data released till March 8 this year.
While in Assam, the percentage is 0.08 (242,655), the data shows that Arunachal has 12.2 % (168,460 persons), Mizoram 26.2 % (286,146), Manipur 41.2 % (1,120,649), Nagaland 43.2 % (856,374), Sikkim 92.4 % (562,562) and Tripura 90.2 % (3,317,808)."

2176,BJP eyes major role in M’laya post 2018 polls,"Monday, April 27, 2015","SHILLONG: The next Assembly elections in Meghalaya are three years away but political activities in the State seems to have already got going with the AICC asking the State government to prepare a progress report of the two years of MUA-II Government and the State BJP deciding to form sub committees to scrutinize the activities of the Congress-led MUA-II Government and to follow up the pending corruption cases under the MUA government.
A BJP State leader on Sunday said party president Amit Shah, during his visit to the State, had asked the State BJP to act as a watch dog and to scrutinize all programmes and policies of the State government and expose corruption cases.
According to the state BJP, the sub committees of the party will play the role of vigilantes aimed at exposing the loopholes of the Congress-led government.
The State BJP is also planning to hold its State Executive Committee meeting shortly to discuss ways and means of strengthening the party at all levels starting from the grass roots ahead of the 2018 Assembly polls.
The visit of the BJP national president seems to have added vigour to the saffron party which does not have any representation in the 60-member Meghalaya Legislative Assembly ansd is eager to become a force to reckon with in the Hill State.
The BJP’s good show during the Lok Sabha polls in urban constituencies of the State and in some seats in Jaintia Hills in 2014, has acted as a morale booster for the BJP.  The State unit of the party was formed in 1991 and since then the BJP has had a mixed run the Meghalaya.
In the 1998 Assembly elections, T.H. Rangad from Laban, A.L. Hek from Pynthorumkhrah and N.N. Simchang from Dalu in West Garo Hills had contested and won on BJP tickets.
In the 2003 Assembly polls, both Rangad and Hek retained their respective seats but Simchang was defeated.
Following the death of Rangad on July 4, 2003, his wife Jopsimon Phanbuh contested and retained the Laban seat for the BJP in the September 2013 by-poll.
In 2008, the BJP secured only one seat when Hek retained the Pynthorumkhrah seat yet again, but he switched allegiance and joined the Congress in 2009, resulting in the BJP drawing a blank in the Assembly thereafter.
In the 2013 Assembly polls, Hek contested on a Congress ticket and won his seat again. The BJP, which had fielded 13 candidates, failed to win even a single seat.
Significantly buoyed by the party’s stupendous victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and assembly elections in several states, the BJP leadership in Meghalaya now wants to rejuvenate the party to ensure that the party will have a say in the government formation in 2018.
The State BJP has also claimed that the party’s membership will touch 70,000 in the State the coming days with vigorous campaigns being undertaken to enroll members in the State."

Speaking to The Shillong Times, Director of Soil and Water Conservation, D Langstieh said that the department is currently in the process of mapping the springs which can be brought under the purview of the project.
The project would be of great help in rejuvenating the ground water system since at the moment most of the water is wasted.
“The idea to come up with the programme was mooted as over the years, many of the springs have dried up or become seasonal and the discharge during the lean season has declined drastically. This has reduced the “sponge action” of the land and consequently limited rainwater percolating down creating a hydrological imbalance in some of the watersheds,” Langstieh informed.
The programme has been implemented successfully in Sikkim where the Government has covered 400 hectares of land under spring-shed development programme with a total investment of Rs 2.5 crore resulting in an annual ground water recharge of 900 mn litres."

2204,‘Ready to use choppers in anti-insurgency ops’,"Saturday, April 25, 2015","SHILLONG: Meghalaya police chief Rajiv Mehta on Friday disclosed that the State Police was not averse to the idea of using helicopters for surveillance, air dropping of police personnel and rations in their fight against militants in Garo Hills.
“If the Ministry of Home Affairs provides us with helicopters, we are willing to use them for logistics,” the DGP told The Shillong Times.
He, however, made it clear that the helicopters, if at all used, will not be pressed into direct operations, but would be meant only for surveillance of inaccessible areas and also to air drop rations and personnel in the areas of operations.
The State government has been contemplating availing helicopters for logistics purposes considering the difficult terrain in Garo Hills.
Mehta also admitted that the difficult terrain in Garo Hills makes it impossible for the security forces to penetrate into the deep areas which result in militants getting the upper hand.
“We find the inaccessible terrain in Garo Hills more difficult to penetrate than most areas in Chhattisgarh where the security forces are fighting the Maoists,” the DGP added.
Caution on fake encounters
The DGP has also cautioned the policemen not to resort to any violation of human rights while carrying out operations against militants.
There have been allegations of fake encounter killings in Garo Hills which prompted the Government to carry out magisterial probes into two such incidents.
According to Mehta, normally the police forces in Meghalaya do not resort to fake encounters as it would be a matter of ‘professional suicide’ for them to resort to such acts.
“Who wants to antagonize the people as the police forces have to mostly depend on the people in their fight against militants,” Mehta said."
2205,KHADC mulls policy to curb ‘nepotism’,"Saturday, April 25, 2015","SHILLONG: A day after RTI findings revealed ‘nepotism’ and ‘favoritism’ in the appointment of staff in the KHADC, an embarrassed Chief Executive member (CEM) Adelbert Nongrum on Friday said that the Council was contemplating to come up with its own ‘recruitment policy’ to ensure transparency in the appointment process.
“We will come up with our own recruitment policy to ensure total transparency in the recruitment process in the Council,” Nongrum said, while admitting that the Council had failed to come up with such a policy since its inception.
“I accept that there was lack of transparency in filling up of vacant posts in the Council in the past. But this kind of discrepancy will no longer be tolerated. We are committed to cleaning the whole mess to lift the image of the KHADC,” the CEM said, while stating “it is never too late to make a new beginning”.
He informed that the Executive Committee was on the job to see that the policy is implemented at the earliest.
He further informed that the Council might constitute an independent body that would be given the responsibility of recruiting staff.
“Any future appointments will be based purely on merit. We want to eradicate the culture of political favoritism,” Nongrum said.
On the charge that most of the top KHADC functionaries were under qualified, the KHADC chief pointed out that the situation was totally different 35 years ago since there were few graduates at that time.
“We should understand that the people occupying the top posts in the Council have reached such positions through promotions. We cannot undermine their capabilities as administrators. I know their capabilities since I work with them,” he said.
Nongrum, however, admitted that the RTI findings, as revealed by the Synjuk Seng Samla Shnong (SSSS), was definitely a ‘wake up’ call to improve the system in the KHADC."
2206,Use of mobiles by UTPs: Shillong jail to have PCO,"Saturday, April 25, 2015","SHILLONG: A Public Call Office (PCO) will be set up in the Shillong district jail to ensure that the jail inmates do not use mobile phones inside the lock-up.
Several cases were reported in the past regarding misuse of mobile phones inside jail by the inmates which had resulted in frequent jail breaks. Moreover, cash was also recovered in the past from the jail inmates.
The jail manual prevents the use of mobile phones and the possession of cash inside the jail.
Additional DGP (Prisons) B.L. Buam told reporters on Friday that since relatives do not turn up to visit the inmates, the jail authorities thought that the system of PCO would alow the inmates to call their family or relatives and inquire about their well being.
“The under trials can make calls once a week monitored by jail authorities. However those detained under MPDA will not be allowed to use the PCO,” Buam said.
As far as the possession of cash by UTPs is concerned Buam said that the jail inmates will be paid for the hard labour they do inside the jail premises.
Buam said that three mobile phones have been recovered in the last few days and one of them belonged to a GNLA cadre. An FIR in this regard was also filed at Sadar Police Station.
“As part of our clean up system in the Shillong district jail, we seized three mobile phones and further action will follow,” Buam said.
Buam said that the GNLA cadre who has been using the mobile phone in the Shillong district jail   surrendered it before the jail officials.
The GNLC cadre confessed that he had received Rs.5000 from his relatives and the same amount was given to jail warder Phrangsngi Kyndiah to purchase the mobile phone, Buam informed.
“Two weeks ago Kyndiah was arrested and discharged from service for his nexus with the jail inmates,” Buam added."
2207,Jail inmates stage hunger strike,"Saturday, April 25, 2015","SHILLONG: Inmates of the Shillong district jail went on hunger strike on Thursday evening in protest against the poor quality of food served to them and also demanded other amenities. The strike was, however, called off on Friday after the intervention of Additional DGP (Prisons) B.L. Buam.
While the jail inmates cited the   poor quality of food and lack of adequate water supply as the reasons for the hunger strike, Buam denied the same and pointed out that the strike was linked to the recovery of mobile phones in the jail.
The jail inmates skipped supper on Thursday and breakfast on Friday, but Buam was able to convince them to call off their strike.
Buam, later, informed the strike was called at the behest a leader of a gang of 10 inmates who demanded Rs.100 as ‘pocket money’, better quality food and uninterrupted water supply.
“We provide food to the jail inmates with the required calories as per the jail manual and there should not be any reason for complaints in this regard,” Buam said.
He also informed that the food was earlier prepared with firewood, but he had arranged for LPG to cook the food faster.
The jail official said that since possession of money by jail inmates was banned as per the jail manual, the demand for pocket money was refused.
Buam further said that the jail authorities had installed plastic pipes to supply water to the jail inmates considering that iron pipes could be misused by them.
Presently, there are 381 under trial prisoners and 30 convicts lodged in Shillong district jail out of whom 21 are lodged in the high security cell."

West Jaintia Hills Deputy Commissioner, WR Lyngdoh along with the district SP and Additional SP had to rush to the spot to take stock of the situation and brought things under control only hours later with the help of the local headman.
According to a senior police official form East Jaintia Hills, the death of a student from Byndihati village on Friday afternoon led to the incident.
“A coal laden truck (AS01CE-3057) hit a Maruti car (ML04-5066) from behind killing the driver of the vehicle, a B.Com student identified as Franky Lyngdoh (24), son of Maising Shylla of Byndihati village on the spot.

New leaders had since been also appointed for the union with himself (Protap) as the president, Sunit Marak as vice president and Sontu Marak as general secretary besides others who till date were still holding their respective positions.
As per Sangma’s revelations there are only 5 regional units of the GSU under Karbi Anglong District which were approved by the GSU, Assam State Zone in 2012.
He also claimed that the creation of illegal new units prior to the GSU, CEC election had now given rise to dissent among the members of the Karbi Anglong Zone."
2233,State BJP demands special category status for M’laya,"Friday, April 24, 2015","SHILLONG: The Meghalaya BJP has appealed to the Union government to accord special status category for Meghalaya.
In a memorandum submitted to BJP national president Amit Shah on Thursday, BJP state president Khlur Sing Lyngdoh said that Meghalaya, being a landlocked hill state, is in dire need for better connectivity through adequate and proper road network and therefore, investment in road infrastructure for the entire State is of prime necessity.
“Being endowed with natural scenic beauty and cultural heritage, Meghalaya can be developed into a tourist destination on the lines of eco-tourism and cultural tourism at international standards,” Lyngdoh said.
The State BJP complained about the political and economic scenario in Meghalaya despite having been a state within the Indian Union for more than 43 years, the State and its people have been stagnated all around without any policy and blueprint to take it forward.
“Lack of employment, agricultural, pro-farmer and mineral or mining policies have resulted in the loss of livelihood to many when the NGT ban on mining came into force since April, 2014,” the BJP said, while adding that Industrial Policy brought in 1997 has proven to be detrimental to the interest and benefit of the majority population in the State.
The party also alleged that corruption at all levels of governance rules the day and lamented that Meghalaya is rich in mineral resources including coal yet the respective governments including the present one have failed to convert these natural resources into benefits for the people of the State except to promote export of coal outside the State and outside the country for exclusive profit of the few rich coal miners.
The party also blamed the State Government for failing to put in place an environment- friendly mining policy though the earlier draft policy was rejected by the people since it was benefitting the rich miners  while ignoring the small and marginal miners of the State.
The BJP also lamented that the State does not have an education policy of its own and therefore, education is directionless, lacks in quality and the standard is very low, almost two years behind the national standard and asked the Union Government to monitor the performance of the State Government in this crucial area of concern, including proper utilization of funds meant to better and promote education in the State as also full and proper implementation of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan scheme, particularly in rural and inaccessible areas.
The party asked Amit Shah to urge the Union Government to bring amendments to the RTE Act whereby religious minority institutions do not face the brunt as is happening in Meghalaya and also to make free education mandatory for children from the age of four till the age of eighteen.
According to the BJP, though border haats have been set up by the State government but the ground reality is much different since the road development and maintenance is being taken up at a very slow pace with the need of quite a number of bridges for road connectivity all along the international border with Bangladesh and in addition porous borders encourage infiltration from across the border and  thievery by persons from the other side into many border villages on the Indian side is a common occurrence.
The State BJP also stressed on the need to solve the long-pending inter- state boundary dispute with Assam saying the boundary issue between Meghalaya and Assam has not been amicably settled giving rise to infrequent border skirmishes between peoples living along the inter- state border, in particular, along Goalpara, Kamrup and Karbi Anglong districts of Assam.
The BJP also suggested that it would be in the best interest of all concerned, even for States outside the region for the Centre to set up a 2nd States Re-organisation Commission or Inter- State Boundary  Commission so that boundary disputes prevailing may be settled once and for all.
The party also demanded that the Shillong Airport at Umroi, which has been in existence for some 30 years, needs to be upgraded immediately since flights operated are only between Shillong and Kolkata and that too, in a very irregular and uncertain manner.
The party demanded air connectivity between Shillong and other airports in the region like Aizawl, Imphal, Agartala, Dimapur, Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Silchar, Bagdogra, Naharlagun and with New Delhi."

2242,‘No ban on cow slaughter in N-E’,"Thursday, April 23, 2015","SHILLONG: BJP national general secretary and former RSS spokesperson Ram Madhav on Wednesday asserted that the BJP-led NDA Government does not intend to ban cow slaughter in the North East region.
Speaking to media persons here on Wednesday, Ram Madhav said ban on cow slaughter has been in place since long in many states but the Union government was not proposing to ban cow slaughter in the North East due to the demographic situation.
Some states have banned cow slaughter based on certain socio-economic factors, he said, adding that the centre would review the same and take    appropriate action.
Asked about the alleged Ghar Wapsi (forced conversion) programme by hardcore Hindu wings, he said, “India is a country of a numbers of religions and pluralism exists in its heart.”
“The government will ensure that every religion and community lives in peace, safety and security,” he said.
On the prospects of the BJP in the Northeastern region, he said that the party was becoming stronger in the region.
Asserting that the BJP and the Government was focused on development of the region, he said that the party will support the government’s initiatives to strengthen the economy of the region by creating avenues for better connection with the neighbouring countries.
Asked for his opinion on the ‘beef party’ protest organised in the city against the visit of BJP national president Amit Shah, he said, “Anybody can protest in a democratic country but their reasons for   protest is misplaced. BJP is committed to unity and integrity of the country.”"
2243,Regional parties raise pitch against ‘beef ban’,"Thursday, April 23, 2015","SHILLONG: The three regional parties in the State – UDP, HSPDP and KHNAM – voiced their concern on issue of ban on cow slaughter in separate meetings with BJP national president Amit Shah here on Wednesday.
Objecting to the purported ban on cow slaughter, the UDP said that people of the North East would neither accept any such imposition on their food habits nor tolerate any breach of the Constitutional provisions.
“Your government is trying to circumvent not only the Constitution of the country, but also the age-old practice followed by many Indians, the several judicial pronouncements including the Supreme Court order on ban on cow slaughter, one of the most famous being the ‘Hasmatullah versus State of Madhya Pradesh (AIR 1996 SC 2076)’ wherein it had stated that banning of cow slaughter ‘has imposed an unreasonable restriction on the Fundamental Right under Article 19 of the Constitution,” the UDP stated in a memorandum submitted to the BJP president.
Referring to the ‘Ghar Wapsi’, the UDP said ‘the party is apt to the current mood in the nation’.
“These irritants have been a blot in the developmental fabric of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji and we in the UDP are observing with keen interest, your party’s slogan and government programme of ‘Ghar Wapsi’. However, we would caution that utmost care should be taken, that the inherent provision of the Right to Freedom of Religion under Article 25 of the Constitution should strictly be adhered to, while in the euphoric implementation of ‘Ghar Wapsi’, please ensure ‘Ghar Torna Nahi’ as India is firmly united than ever,” the regional party said in the memorandum.
The UDP team consisted of party president Donkupar Roy, working presidents Bindo Lanong and Paul Lyngdoh, legislator Jemino Mawthoh and party general secretary Allantry Dkhar, among others.
The HSPDP also raised concerns over anti-Christian activities under the BJP regime.
“We raised the issue of ban on cow slaughter, the law and order situation in Meghalaya and the need to implement the Inner Line Permit in the State to prevent influx,” party leader Ardent Basaiawmoit said later.     The HSPDP also raised the issue of the inter-state and the Indo-Bangladesh border disputes.
“The BJP president conveyed to us that the party is not against any religion and the BJP would not go for any forceful ban on cow slaughter since it is a State Subject,” Basaiawmoit said.
A KHNAM delegation consisting of party leaders Adelbert Nongrum and Pyndap Saibon, among others, also expressed its opposition against the move of the NDA government to ban cow slaughter.
The delegation also stressed on the need to uphold the values of secularism.
KHNAM also demanded adequate measures to address the issue of influx, and objected to uranium mining in Meghalaya.
UDP, KHNAM blame Congress for KHADC mess
The UDP and the KHNAM blamed the Congress for the ongoing political instability in the KHADC while raising the matter with the BJP party president.
Both the regional parties, albeit separately, appraised the BJP leader of the Congress government’s ploy to destabilize the KHADC led by regional parties.
“The Congress government in the State has been instrumental in effecting instability in the KHADC,” the UDP stated in a memorandum submitted to the BJP president.
The UDP pointed out that the State government had recommended Administrator’s Rule ignoring the fact that the ruling coalition enjoyed majority in the House. “The State Government even refused to comply with the Governor’s advice to reconsider its decision to impose Administrator’s Rule. This is a classic case of the Congress’s traits of manipulation and subversion of Constitutional authority,” the party said.
The UDP also mentioned that the Congress government had extended the tenure of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council unconstitutionally on three occasions to continue to be in power.
The KHNAM urged the Central government to appoint a full-fledged Governor for Meghalaya. The delegation also sought the intervention of the Centre to prevent the Congress-led State government from trying to dislodge the KHADC EC.
Strangely, however, the HSPDP did not make any mention of the KHADC affairs during their meeting with the BJP chief.
‘Militancy a result of Congress mis-rule’
The UDP also stated that the Congress-ruled states in the North East, in particular Meghalaya, are gravely entrenched in misrule and corruption, thus giving rise to militancy and other forms of law and order situations.
“Many of the frustrated youths are venting out their frustrations, anger and reactions in forms counterproductive to the overall development of the State and the region as well,” the UDP memorandum stated.
The party pointed out that there were serious allegations of the politico-militant nexus with respect to the ongoing problem in the Garo Hills, and a charge sheet to this effect had been hand delivered to the President, copies of which were sent to the then Prime Minister and Home Minister but no action has been forth coming.
“It is noteworthy to mention, that we have a Congress Chief Minister (Mukul Sangma) who has lost the moral right to govern, by virtue of the fact that his own constituency has been reeling under the direct diktat of the militant outfit GNLA, and has been experiencing a total lock down for the past two months and is currently facing an indefinite bandh called by GNLA,” the UDP said while questioning the Chief Minister’s right to continue in the post since he had failed in bringing peace and normalcy in his own constituency.
According to the UDP, “Many major scams involving the tainted Ministers and Congress leaders, seem to have vanished into thin air, while on the other hand, the overflowing influx from neighbouring countries, which are the Congress vote bank(s) are causing serious demographic imbalances in this part of the country.”
“Unless some effective, concrete and amenable approach is worked out from the Centre, this menace will jeopardize the future of the country,” the UDP said.
On the issue of boundary dispute, the party said that the protracted boundary disputes of the state is another clear example of the Congress’ avid agenda of increasing its vote bank politics at the cost of illegal immigration and the decision of the UPA government to fence the international boundary, 150 metres from the zero point has been opposed because this will only result in loss of huge tracts of land that have been historically and until now belonged to our people.
“Presently, the government has been adopting measures through the election department, in the garb of enrolment of voters, by posting officers that are not sensitive to the demographics of the State, who have been found to be encouraging immigrants along the border areas, to enroll in the voters list, that has resulted in incidents of communal disharmony, and this could be the genesis of another major law and order problem in the State,” the UDP said.
On the developmental front, the UDP said, “The airways in Meghalaya is being plagued by the inability of the state government to effectively make them commercially viable hindering the process of economic development. As a party, we are not averse to a cargo or goods’ rail connection up to a designated area, a few kilometres inside the State, but we have vehemently opposed the current plan of connecting the state’s capital, on grounds of environmental degradation and serious demographic imbalances.”
Referring to the National Green Tribunal’s ban on coal mining that has had repercussions in the economy of the State, the UDP said that the absence of a Natural Resource Management Policy and the lack of political will to use these resources for the benefit of the State is a glaring example of gross misrule of the Congress for furthering corrupt practices.
“The recent natural calamity that affected the Garo Hills sector of the State, which suffered immensely because of the floods, will require an in-depth study, so as to prevent such disasters from recurring,” the memorandum stated."

2249,"NESO, KSU call on BJP chief","Thursday, April 23, 2015","SHILLONG: The NESO and KSU in a joint meeting here on Wednesday urged BJP president Amit Shah to exempt Meghalaya from the purview of the Indo-Nepal Treaty besides calling for the need to have a full proof mechanism in place to tackle the influx of illegal immigrants into the State.
“We request you to initiate immediate steps to exempt the State from the Indo-Nepal Friendship Treaty, 1950 in order to protect the indigenous people from being overwhelmed by the Nepalese immigrants, thereby disturbing the social, political economic and demography of the State,” NESO chairman Samuel Jyrwa and KSU president Daniel Khyriem stated in a joint representation submitted to the BJP president.
While calling upon the need to have a full proof mechanism to tackle the issue of influx of illegal immigrants, both Jyrwa and Khyriem said that the people of the State are constantly overwhelmed by these foreigners-socially, economically, politically- and that this could result in a disastrous demographic imbalance.
“The presence of large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and their continuous infiltration have instilled a sense of insecurity  in the minds of the indigenous people. It is high time that the Union Government takes effective and immediate measures to protect the indigenous people,” the two leaders said.
The student leaders suggested that stringent measures should be adopted by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure that the ‘illegal immigrants’ are not able to enroll themselves to the State electoral list easily.

2250,"CSWO, others submit memos","Thursday, April 23, 2015","SHILLONG: The CSWO on Wednesday raised the issues of inter-State boundary dispute, militancy, alleged fake encounters among others in a memorandum submitted to BJP president, Amit Shah.
In the memorandum, CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing said that from the decades-old inter-state boundary issue with Assam to the constant terror in Garo Hills created by mushrooming militancy and by police, and from the killing of an honest police sub-inspector to rampant diversion of the  Public Distribution System (PDS), Meghalaya’s problems were diverse.
She also alleged that the Hill State is being governed by a group of politicians who have amassed wealth in a short time and are not serious to attend to the various issues ailing the people.
Referring to the long pending inter-State boundary with Assam, she said that Meghalaya has no official map and it was only in 2009 the map was made by the Geological Survey of India on instructions of the Union DONER ministry and boundaries shown in the same have actually reduced the limits of the State.
“Meghalaya had an area of over 22,500 sq kms, but now it has been reduced to 22,429 sq kms. In addition to this, there are the disputed areas, which remain unresolved till date,” she said in the memorandum.
She alleged that the delay in resolving the boundary issue and drawing the actual map of the State has led to much human rights violation and abuse of power by the State of Assam through its police.
On the militancy problem in Garo Hills, Kharshiing said that the people in the area are eager to rally for peace and normalcy but are hindered due to rise in militancy and abuse of power by some police personnel.
She also alleged that extortion by some men-in-uniform is also rampant along the national highways of Meghalaya. “This extortion leads to price rise of essential commodities,” she said.
Meanwhile, referring to the recent case of the murder of Sub-Inspector Pearly Joshua Marbaniang, Kharshiing alleged that the cop was killed by fellow policemen on January 24, a day after he detained 32 trucks, which were plying illegally from Patharkhmah, Ri-Bhoi.
She also highlighted the various anomalies that plague the Public Distribution System (PDS) in the State.

After meeting the BJP president, Banteilang Singh Rumnong, general secretary, Seng Khasi, Shillong said that with the spread of Christianity, a large percentage of the members of the Khasi and Jaintia tribes were subjected to conversion.
“Presently, the State is predominantly Christian and the indigenous religious practitioners of Khasi and Jaintia tribes have been reduced to a minority, who if not protected or given due recognition will swiftly erode further,” the Seng Khasi and Sein Raij said in a memorandum submitted to the BJP leader.
According to Rumnong, while the Christians in the state enjoy the privileges of being scheduled tribes and minorities, the Seng Khasi and Sein Raij are yet to be considered minorities and hence asked the centre to intervene in bringing about changes."

TURA: West Garo Hills police have arrested two villagers who were allegedly behind the shooting at the office of the Pro Vice Chancellor of NEHU Tura campus on Saturday night.
Police picked up two local hunters on Tuesday evening who have been identified as Slayer  Ch Marak (31) and Markut A Sangma (26), both hailing from Chasingre village, for their alleged involvement in the incident.
The two arrested villagers reportedly confessed to police that they were out hunting for wild animals in the vicinity of the NEHU campus when they fired from their weapon resulting in damage to the Pro VC’s office.
Police have also seized the country made weapon along with five live rounds of ammunition from the possession of the arrested duo.

2258,CCIB skips border inspection,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","SHILLONG: The Coordination Committee of International Border (CCIB) did not take part in the joint inspection of the Indo-Bangladesh border which got underway on Tuesday.
The CCIB along with Directorate of Land Survey and NBCC was supposed to have a joint survey starting from boundary pillar number 1273 at Dawki to boundary pillar number 1299 at Jaliakhola from April 21 till 27.
“We have decided to discontinue our participation of the joint inspection after officials of the Directorate of Land Survey insisted that the boundary  fencing should erected 150 yards inside the zero line,” the CCIB member Joe Marwein said on Tuesday.
He said that his organization had been maintaining from the beginning that the boundary fencing should be from the Zero Line since the villagers residing along the border would lose a large chunk of their agricultural land if the fencing is erected 150 yards inside the Zero Line.
“There should be proper demarcation of the boundary with Bangladesh on the Meghalaya sector of the international border before undertaking fencing along the Zero Line,” Marwein added.
It may be mentioned that the Indo-Bangla border in Meghalaya stretches up to 443 kms out of which 350 kilometers have been fenced while around 80 kilometers remain unfenced in Khasi and Jaintia Hills due to land acquisition hurdles. Another stretch of 18-19 kms which passes through forest land has also remained unfenced pending necessary clearance from the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest.
Earlier, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju had said that the Centre would complete the fencing work along the Indo-Bangla international border within a year provided the State Government acquires and hands over the land for this much-delayed project. He added that all issues can be sorted out if the State Government makes some extra efforts."
2259,NGT order challenged,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","SHILLONG: The All Meghalaya Commercial Truck Owners and Operators Association has filed a petition before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) challenging the tribunal’s earlier directive in which coal miners and transporters were asked to pay Rs 485 as Environment Fund for  every metric tone of coal.
Speaking to media person in Shillong on Tuesday, the Meghalaya Commercial Truck Owners and Operators Association president, A Shanpru said that the environment fund rate was too high and finding no other option, the organization had to move the NGT.
The petition was filed by the Association on April 6 and the association sought an exemption from the environment fund as directed by NGT.
According to Shanpru, two hearings of the case were held on April 15 and April 21. The third hearing will be held on April 30 in Delhi.
“Besides the capacity fee, we cannot afford to pay the environment fee. This is affecting many of us,” the MCTOA president said adding that this order should be modify in the interest of all the people involved in coal mining.
“We want the NGT to revoke and modify this order,” he said.
It may be mentioned that the fund will be used for restoration of environment  as per the recent directive of the National Green Tribunal."

2261,Bindo bats for special session,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","SHILLONG: United Democratic Party (UDP) working president and former KHADC CEM Bindo M Lanong has suggested that the best formula to end the political drama in KHADC would be to convene a session where both ruling and the opposition can show their strength.
Speaking to media persons on the sideline of a function here, Lanong said that the best place to end the stalemate is not home or Raj Bhavan but the session where the majority can be proved.
Stating that the stalemate in the KHADC has become a three cornered tussle between the Government, the Governor and the KHADC, he said that the Government till now has not even appointed the administrator in the KHADC even though they have recommended for imposition of Administrator’s Rule.
Stating that the Governor has the power to convene the session, Lanong accused that the Congress would always like to have its own Executive Committee  and this is proved by the fact that the State Government has extended the term of GHADC on three occasions.
Reacting to a query, he said that the provisions of the Tenth Schedule should be extended to the Autonomous District Councils.
“In 2010 when I was the Law Minister we had passed a resolution in the Assembly and it was sent to the Union Government but now we don’t know the status or whether any reminder was sent to the Central Government,” he said."
2262,Confusion galore in listing landowners in Umroi-Umden,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","SHILLONG: The Public Accounts Committee of the State Legislature visited Umroi on April 17 to take stock of the land compensation issue in Umroi – an issue that has stalled the completion of Umroi Airport. The PAC members comprising Ronnie Lyngdoh (Congress), Paul Lyngdoh (UDP), HS Lyngdoh(HSPDP) and PN Syiem (Congress) were supposed to arrive at the venue of the meeting at Umden Mission but they were reportedly taken to Madan Umsaitprah.
The affected landowners had waited at Umden Mission since 11 am when they saw the Revenue Officials of Ri Bhoi District coming towards their area. But by 1 pm they had all left as they realized that the PAC members had been taken to a different venue.
The land acquisition process in Umroi has turned into a can of worms. It is alleged by some landowners that while the compensation for their land was paid @ Rs 250 per square metre and @ Rs 300 per square metre for paddy land which works out to Rs 23-25 per sq ft, the price of land that they have to purchase in lieu of what they had surrendered to the Govt is @ Rs 200-250 per sq ft.
The survey of land for upgradation of Umroi airport started way back in 2007. Compensation for the land was paid only in 2011 and for the buildings (structure) in 2014. In some cases it is alleged that family feuds have arisen as compensation was paid to one member of the family while others were not yet paid. An example is of a couple with three daughters. The couple have since expired but they had  willed their land to their three daughters. For some strange reason only the youngest daughter was paid compensation. Thereafter her two siblings accused her of foul play when she is unaware of the proceedings by which she was paid compensation.
Other land owners allege that they were paid compensation for the land in bits and pieces where only the chicken shed is included in the land acquisition documents whereas the main residence was excluded although that portion was also taken by the Govt.
There is also some land which is noted as ‘owner unknown.’ The villagers claim that there is no such land with unknown owners but it has happened due to oversight or some foul play within the village itself as the village leaders have themselves been involved in misleading or colluding with Revenue Officials of the Govt.
Land owners of Umden Pyllun and the Rangbah Shnong of Umden Arka, Umden Umsaitprah and Umden Mission have stated that the one week time frame given by the PAC to the Deputy Commissioner, Ri Bhoi District to put together the documents related to land compensation, violates the rights of those whose names have been excluded. They said that the PAC members have not met and interacted with all the land owners whose names have been omitted inadvertently or by design by the Revenue officials.
The land owners allege that some self-styled village leaders have prevented them from getting documents   vide RTI saying that this might result in land compensation being further delayed. But they later found out that those leaders have received their compensation even while they told the villagers not to accept the compensation and to bargain for a higher deal.
The land owners would also be meeting the DC Ri Bhoi to urge upon her not to hurry up with the process of documentation but to ensure that all names of beneficiaries are included and that the problem of compensation is sorted out once and for all."
2263,PAC unearths more anomalies,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","SHILLONG: The Assembly Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday quizzed the officials of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department on the bye-species mechanized abattoir project at Jowai during the final hearing.
“During the questioning of the officials of the department, we have oral evidence that the former director of the department has released the mobility funds upto 30 percent instead of 10 percent to the Chennai-based consortium and its local partner Rishan Rapsang,” PAC member Paul Lyngdoh told newsmen after completing the hearing.
According to Lyngdoh, the department had released a total amount of Rs 1.81 crore as mobility amount which is highly questionable.
He further said that the firm was supposed to deposit 10 percent of the Rs 7.75 crore, which is total cost of the project.
“But surprisingly the firm was allowed to pay only Rs 2 lakh as security deposit.  This clearly shows that the firm was given undue favour,” the PAC member said.
Lyngdoh also said that the project was supposed to be completed within 12 months after it was allotted on September 2012.
He further said that he PAC was more concerned with the amount already paid which was not utilized for more than two and half years.
“The construction period of the abattoir has lapsed if it is taken from the legal perspective. The PAC viewed with serious concern that the department did not bother to follow up the matter with the consortium to protect its own interest, interest of public fund and interest of the project itself which is dereliction of duty on the part of the department,” he said.
Lyngdoh recalled that the spot inspection revealed work done so far is the construction of a shed worth Rs 4 to 5 lakh and installation of the transformer worth Rs 4.5 lakh adding that the department had so far spent a total amount of Rs 8.5 lakh out of the total 1.81 crore."
2264,Fisheries office inaugurated; completed on record time,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","Shillong: The District Fisheries Office constructed at a cost of Rs.5.47 crore was inaugurated on Tuesday. The three-storied building constructed on 2600 sq metres of land includes a training hall, conference room, aquarium for ornamental fish, a pantry, guest rooms and a library besides other utility rooms. Principal Secretary, Fisheries, K.N. Kumar says the building is futuristic and will look after the needs of the Department for the next 30 years.
The plush office space has replaced the old, dilapidated, Assam-type building which was inherited from the Assam Government in 1972. Kumar says the challenge is to maintain the building to meet national and international standards.
Addressing the audience, Additional Chief Secretary K.S. Kropha who was instrumental in sanctioning the project in 2012 as Principal Secretary, Planning Department, said he is happy to note that the construction has come up at a healthy congenial space.
“There is no excuse for the officers and staff not to perform. I hope this office building becomes more people friendly and that farmers are able to access it more easily,” Kropha said adding that officials are public   servants and must act as such.
“Every farmer or individual who comes to public servants must be given a decent hearing. Even if their demands cannot be immediately met there is a way to explain to people without hurting their feelings. How we act or react with people on a day to day basis is extremely important. Officers need to be more polished and appreciate the problems faced by farmers,” Kropha said.
Kropha also pointed out that this is the first project with no time and cost overruns.
Chief Secretary Barkos Warjri stated that since the launch of the Aquaculture Mission three years ago, the Fisheries Department has shown that it can deliver. From 4000 MT of fish in three years the yield has doubled to 8000 MT, Warjri said. He said it is encouraging to see people requesting the government to assist them with fish ponds.
“Meghalaya’s requirement of fish is 33,000 MT annually so we still have a long way to go to achieve self-sufficiency in fish production but the Department must rise to the challenge. Meghalaya has to compete with states like Assam and Manipur in fish production,” Warjri said.
Explaining that the Aquaculture Mission is an offshoot of the 1000 pond scheme of the central government that ended in 2011, Kumar said that 500 hectares of water area have been brought under this scheme with 695 farmers involved in fish farming. Informing the audience about the impact of the scheme in which the Meghalaya Co-operative Apex Bank (MCAB) is a partner, Kumar said the impact of the credit-linked scheme according to studies is heartwarming.
Kumar informed that 65 per cent of the 2336 farmers have fully repaid their loans, 27 per cent partially paid and 7.5 per cent have defaulted but mainly due to the fact that those farmers have died.
In terms of direct impact there is a 34.75 per cent increase in family income. 40 per cent of all additional income has gone into the education of farmer’s children, 16 per cent of them have invested in better housing and 14 per cent have put their profits in purchase of livestock.
The Aquaculture Mission has been able to plug the gaps found in the earlier programmes, Kumar said."

2269,Child adoption rate: M’laya lies at the bottom,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","NEW DELHI: Despite the fact that there are over 50,000 orphaned or abandoned children, mostly girls, in the country, the rate of adoption in India has gone down drastically in the last five years.
The adoption rate by Indians as well as those by foreign nationals has gone down by nearly 50 per cent in the last five years, according to official figures and tedious adoption norms and a slow judicial process further dampened the adoption process.
While figures from most Indian states are not very encouraging, the adoption numbers in Meghalaya are even more surprising. As per a report, only four children were adopted in the Hill State in the last five years making it the lowest in the country.
While 1,606 children were adopted in Maharashtra in 2010, the highest in the country, the figure came down to 1,212 in 2013. Similarly, Tamil Nadu was on the second spot with 693 adoptions in 2010.
While South Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala have still maintained a relatively high rate of adoption, states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Goa and Uttarakhand, along with the North-Eastern states, have recorded an abysmally low number of child adoptions.
The Union Territory of Chandigarh, too, fared poorly with just nine adoptions during 2010 to 2014.
Officials say that the low rate of adoption in the North-Eastern states was primarily due to absence of government-recognized adoption agencies in the region.
“States like Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh do not have any registered agency due to which adoption of children has taken a hit in these states,” they added.
As per Government records, 6,321 children were adopted in the country in 2010, but the number of adoptions came down to 4,354 in 2013. The figures declined further as per the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA), which is the nodal agency for in-country and inter-country adoption of children in India. Also, 70 to 80 per cent of cases pertain to girl child which deters the adoption agencies from being pro-active.
In the international front, the US has adopted 672 Indian children in the last five years, followed by Italy and United Arab Emirates.
Meanwhile, India has asked all its passport department offices to expedite the process of issuing passports to inter-country adopted children. As adoption in India is going down drastically, the Central Government has decided to ease the existing norms to facilitate adoption by foreign nationals in India.
The MEA’s reaction came after the Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry wrote to it, pointing out that some abandoned and orphaned inter-country adopted children are facing difficulties in obtaining birth certificates, which is a mandatory requirement for obtaining a passport.
The Indian Government, as per the provisions of the Hague Convention, had asked all its passport department offices to expedite the process of issuing passports to inter-country adopted children. The MEA had also waived the requirement of police verification for such children in the past.
Addressing the national meet on adoption organized by the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) recently, Union WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi had expressed concerns over the slow rate of adoptions. “The adoption rate of 800 to 1,000 per year in India, which has around 50,000 orphan children, is shameful,” she had noted. She insisted on increasing the number of children being adopted per year failing which the worst performing adoption agencies will be shut down immediately."

A legislator, who is part of the group of aggrieved legislators including Celestine Lyngdoh who could not attend Monday’s meeting as he was out of station, said on Monday that though there was no official meeting among themselves, there was an informal exchange of ideas as there was no feedback from MPCC president to their letter of protest.
“We will have a meeting of the group of eight (G-8) legislators soon to discuss our grievances and how to address them,” the dissident legislator said.
Last week, Congress legislators Ronnie Lyngdoh, Coming One Ymbon, Kennedy Khyriem, Pynshgainlang Syiem, Celestine Lyngdoh and associated members of the Congress Justine Dkhar, Robinus Syngkon and Stephanson Mukhim wrote to the MPCC president expressing concern over the whole cabinet keeping aloof and not bothered to listen to the various grievances of the legislators."
2280,Call for separate schemes for single mothers,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","SHILLONG: National Commission for Women (NCW) member Laldiangliani Sailo has said single motherhood is one of the growing problems in the country, which requires the more attention by the Centre and commitment of more resources towards their betterment.
“It (single motherhood) is perhaps one of the major growing problems in the country and the world. In the light of this, single mothers deserve a separate set of schemes and programmes for their well being,” Sailo said while addressing a National Consultation on issues related to single mothers here on Monday.
“We also need to take note that this is not just for the sake of single mothers alone, but also because of the ramifications this has for society,” she said urging the Centre to take a holistic look and adopt “integrated approaches” towards them.
“It is not a bad idea to create a separate schemes and programmes for the single mother. I would suggest that this conference should debate and consider whether single mothers should be considered as a separate category as they have their own  special problems,” Sailo said.
Sailo observed that till few years ago, the government did not even recognize single mothers as a category that needed special schemes.
“Most states have now recognised the need for making provision of pension for single mothers in their plans. But, the pensions are low… just around Rs 1,000 a month,” Sailo said.
The NCW member emphasised the need to increase the pension for single mothers to a level that would enable the women to look after themselves and her children.
Highlighting that skill development was important to alleviate the problem, the NCW member said providing vocational training to such women was as critical to enhance their lives.
She said that another scheme of Central Government “Swaddhar Greh” under the Ministry of WCD which caters women in difficult circumstances.
“The home or greh also includes mother along with their children (girls below 18 and boys below 12). This is a very laudable scheme. But the numbers of beneficiaries for this scheme are limited,” NCW member said.
On the issue of economic opportunities of women, Sailo said that even in the matrilineal society like Meghalaya and Kerala, things may not be different because there would not be many women who own a property that gives them an income.
“Many are too poor to own a property and others may at best own a small dwelling unit. It is commonly seen that many of the single mother are not able to meet their expenses on food, clothing, children’s education, electricity and medicine,” Sailo said.

2283,‘Large number of female sex workers are single mothers’,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","SHILLONG: There are as many as 273 female sex workers who are single mothers out of a total of 699 female sex workers registered with Manbha Foundation, its director, Dr. Rica Lamar said on Monday.
Quoting from the reports of the targeted intervention project taken up by Manbha Foundation in Shillong, Dr. Lamar said that out of the 379 female sex workers, 173 are single mothers (22 are separated, four are widowed while 147 are living with regular partners).
She also revealed that the average numbers of children that these single mothers have are between two to five.
“The female sex workers are home based, hotel based and also street based,” she said while presenting her paper on the emerging issues of single mother leading to sex work and substance abuse during the two-day consultations on issues related to single mothers held at the Conference Hall of the Indian Council for Social Science and Research, NEHU Campus, which got underway on Monday.
Dr. Lamar also said that in Jowai, out of the 320 female sex workers registered with the Foundation, 100 are single mothers. “A majority of them are Dhaba based or highway based sex workers,” she said.
Dr. Lamar pointed out that structural determinants such as poverty, gender inequality and lack of viable opportunities have forced single mothers to join the sex trade.
“Most of the women on the street are there to keep their families together,” she added.
According to her, 90 per cent of the single mothers who have turned to the sex trade have a history of marital abuse and adultery by their spouses. Some of them had alcoholic husbands and were made to endure violence by their spouses.
“Repeated violence leads to feelings of humiliation and entrapment. Many of these single mothers have said that at the time of marriage, they gave a high degree of importance to their relationship with expectations of emotional, physical and financial security for them and their children. A breakdown in the relationship leads to a sense of rejection and devaluation thus reducing their self esteem and a loss of a robust and authentic sense of self. These women experience anger towards the promiscuous behavior of their husbands and express their anger by resorting to a similar behavior and thus started the journey towards becoming sex workers,” she said.
Dr. Lamar also pointed out that some of them had husbands who used them as sex objects only but did not fulfill any of their duties as husbands and fathers.
“This has made them use men for sexual gratification and to generate money,” she added."
2284,Miscreants fire at NEHU Pro-VC’s office,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","TURA: Unidentified miscreants fired shots at the office of the Pro-Vice-Chancellor located at the centre of the NEHU Tura campus at Chasingre, near Tura, damaging three windows on Saturday night prompting Tura Police to launch an investigation to ascertain the facts.
The incident is believed to have taken place sometime during the late hours of Saturday when the office premise was deserted and the damage was spotted only on Sunday morning by the security staff of the institute.
“We do not know why the office was targeted and by whom but we have filed a police complaint after coming to know about the incident. Three window panes were damaged,” said Pro Vice Chancellor of NEHU, Tura Campus, Prof. Eugene Thomas while speaking to The Shillong Times on Monday.
The firing is believed to have been carried out from either a musket or a country-made weapon since pellets have been found inside the room and on the walls.
“There were five holes on the window and two marks on the wall caused by the impact of the bullets. A search was conducted but nothing was found. The bullets are country made,” revealed district police chief Mukesh Kr Singh.
He added that an FIR was filed by an assistant professor of NEHU on the incident and the complainant had also bought along the pellets found and collected from the scene of the firing.

2292,KHADC stalemate completes a month,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","SHILLONG: A month after the resignation of Adelbert Nongrum from the post of Chief Executive Member (CEM), the stalemate in the KHADC continues as Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi is yet to accept the Meghalaya government’s recommendation to impose Administrator’s Rule in the district council.
Since the Governor is yet to accept Nongrum’s resignation, the Executive Committee headed by the later is still functioning.
Speaking to The Shillong Times on Monday, Nongrum said that he had tendered his resignation on March 19, but the Governor is yet to accept the same.
Ironically, the move to impose  Administrator’s  Rule in the KHADC and the election of UDP MDC Metabh Lyngdoh as the new leader of the All Regional Parties’ Alliance (ARPA) by way of change of leadership  has not affected Nongrum as he still continues to run the Council’s administration as the CEM.
Nongrum criticized dissident MDCs who had switched their allegiance to the Opposition Congress with an excuse that the CEM lacked leadership qualities.
“I did not give in to their (dissident MDCs) demands so they accused me of being slow in talking decision,” Nongrum said.
In fact, the dissident MDCs left ARPA since they could not fulfill their personal agenda, Nongrum alleged.
Though the State Cabinet imposed Administrator’s Rule in the KHADC on March 18, Governor Tripathi refused to give his assent to the recommendation and asked the government to review the decision.
On April 1, the state Cabinet decided to stick to its earlier decision of imposing Administrator’s Rule.
The ARPA is still waiting for an audience with the Governor for convening a special session to elect the CEM as the alliance of regional parties has reiterated they have the support of 16 members in the House of 30."

2294,HYC demands apology from IPS officer posted in Sohra,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","SHILLONG: The Hynniewtrep Youth Council (HYC) has demanded an unconditional apology from Yangchen D Bhutia, an IPS officer posted in Sohra PS, for allegedly labeling the people of Sohra as ‘backward’ and ‘drunkards’.
“We feel deeply insulted by the remarks of the senior police officer,” HYC president Shan Nongrum said in a statement on Monday.
He said it was unbecoming of a police officer to term the whole community as ‘drunkards’ and ‘backward’.
“We will not accept any negative remark which is demeaning to the whole community. We expect officers coming to serve in the State to show some respect to the local people,” Nongrum said.
The comment was made by Bhutia on April 13 when a group of HYC members had gone to the police station to response to the summon notice issued by this police officer.
According to the HYC president, Bhutia had served a summon notice to the HYC asking them to appear before her on April 11 based on reports that they had driven away non-tribal labourers working in Sohra without the knowledge of the police.
The HYC members responded to the summon three days later and expressed their desire to communicate in the local language to ‘express themselves better’, Nongrum said, adding that there were many Khasi police officials present there to do the translation work.
“The officer in charge (Bhutia) got irritated and started calling us illiterate and drunken,” Nongrum added.
The HYC chief, meanwhile, denied their involvement in any anti-infiltration drive and said, “If we had done it we would have handed over the labourers to the police. We have conducted such drives in the past and whenever we have found any anomaly in the work permit issued to the labourers we have handed them over to the police,” Nongrum said.
Meanwhile, questions are being raised on why an officer of the rank of IPS, was serving as the officer in-charge of a police station. Also surprising is the fact that the summon notice issued by the IPS officer to the HYC was without proper seal and had not been handwritten.
When contacted, East Khasi Hills Superintendent of Police M. Kharkrang informed that Yangchen D Bhutia was a 2012 batch IPS officer from Sikkim, and had been posted at Sohra PS under probation."

“The medical college proposed at Tura is being funded by the Government. But the medical college in Shillong is coming up under the Public Private Partnership mode,” HPF president Tynshain Lapang said on Monday, while informing that they had inspected the project site and wer surprised to find that the construction work was yet to take off.
“We are of the view that the medical college in Shillong should also be funded by the government. We have doubts on whether the project under the PPP mode will see the light of the day as has been the case with many other projects where the government had signed MoUs with private partners,” he said.
The HPF suspected that there was a ‘hidden agenda’ behind the two different decisions taken by the government.
Lapang claimed that there will be vast donations made for getting admission into the MBBS courses for the Shillong Medical College as it would be owned by a private company.
Lapang further asked the State government to make public the content of the agreement signed by the government with the Kolkata-based KPC Group and also to convene a public hearing on whether the Shillong medical College should be under the PPP mode or not."

V. Narayanasamy, ex-MP and AICC, in charge of Meghalaya and Dr. Vijay Laxmi Sadho,  AICC Secretary in charge  Meghalaya, accompanied the delegation.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mukul Sangma, Lapang, Deborah Marak  and a host top party functionaries attended Sunday’s rally.
Addressing the rally Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi  accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi  of seeking to return “debt of industrialists” and vowed to fight for farmers’ interests and against the “weakened” land bill in his first public rally after returning from a 56-day leave of absence.
The BJP hit back, wondering how many times the Congress will launch him.
The Congress sought to put the Narendra Modi government on notice over its land bill with all its top leaders – Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh – signalling the party’s intention to make it a rallying point in the party’s efforts to revive itself electorally after the debacle in the last Lok Sabha election.
“How Modi won the election? He took loans of thousands of crores from big industrialists from which his campaigning was done. How will he meet the obligation? He will do it by giving (them) your land. He wants to weaken the land bill,” Rahul Gandhi said at a well attended Kisan-Khet Mazdooor rally at the Ramlila Maidan. (With inputs from agencies)"

Informing this here on Sunday, Urban Affairs Minister Ampareen Lyngdoh said, “We will be submitting the report to the tribunal during the next hearing”.
According to her, MUDA had already served notices to the people residing along the Wahumkhrah river asking them to prove their antecedents and ownership of the land.
“We have taken all precautions while dealing with this issue and we will also not like to take any decision which may lead us into any legal tangle like in the past,” the Urban Affairs Minister said.
It may be mentioned that MUDA in 2011 had served an eviction notice to demolish the illegal structures along Wahumkhrah. However, this attempt on the part of MUDA suffered a blow when a local court clamed a stay on MUDA order.
Earlier, MUDA had received as many as 200 responses from residents living near the Wahumkhrah River following the NGT order."

2305,A period of unfulfilled promises: Opp,"Monday, April 20, 2015","
SHILLONG: There is nothing much  to cheer about the governance under Chief Minister Mukul Sangma,  who completes five years in office , though interrupted, on April 20, according to the Opposition.
After three years of Congress rule under Sangma from April 20, 2010, he assumed office as Chief Minister again on March 5, 2013 after the State Assembly polls.
When contacted to comment on the five years of Mukul Sangma as Chief Minister, the NPP legislator James Sangma said sarcastically that in 2010 there were only two militant outfits, HNLC and ANVC, but in 2015 there are more than 21 militant outfits especially in Garo Hills indicating the worsening law and order situation in Garo Hills.
From April 20, 2010 to March 5, 2013, Sangma became the Chief Minister of Meghalaya for the first time replacing Congress veteran DD Lapang, who was in power from May 13,   2009 to April 19, 2010 after a brief spell of President’s rule from March 18, 2009 to May 12 of the same year.
In fact it was first the Congress under the leadership of Lapang who formed the Government on March 4, 2008, soon after the Assembly elections which, however, lasted only for 16 days.  Following this, the UDP-NPP combined got an opportunity to form the Government for just one year under the leadership of Donkupar Roy from March 19, 2008. However, this Government was toppled by the Congress resulting in the imposition of the President’s rule.
After the Assembly elections  in 2013, Mukul Sangma was again made the Chief Minister with the support of 29 Congress legislators, 2 NCP members and 11 Independents.
The NPP legislator James Sangma said that there were no signs of positive development during the five year tenure of Chief Minister.
“Crime against women is on the rise, so also is the militancy graph in Garo Hills. From just 2 militant groups, there are more than 21 groups in Garo Hills”, Sangma said.
Corruption is another factor which marked the five year rule of Mukul Sangma, according to NPP leader.
The NPP also wondered as to why no action was taken by the Chief Minister  against persons including the  Cabinet Minister  at the helm of affairs in education department  for the education scam whereas the Chief Minister was prompt in taking action against  another cabinet minister for the alleged links with a militant group.
He also criticized the Chief Minister for carrying out both domestic and foreign tours thereby giving little time to address the various needs of the people in State.
The tours of the Chief Minister also resulted in draining the state exchequer as there is severe financial crunch, he added.
The working president of UDP and former Deputy Chief Minister Bindo Lanong said that there are more failures than success stories during the five year tenure of the Chief Minister
The Chief Minister has made a lot of promises, but he failed to fulfill the same.  “We also want to know how he will set up the much promised Times Square in Polo”, Lanong said.
“Whenever  the Chief  Minister comes back from  foreign tours, he makes a lot of promises in terms of  rice cultivation after the Manila visit, improvement in piggery and bamboo cultivation after other foreign visits, but they are yet to materialize”, Lanong said.
He also said the Government led by Mukul Sangma has mishandled the NGT ban on coal mining resulting in death of three persons.
According to Lanong, the Mookhep firing incident which resulted in the death of two villagers should have been avoided. Moreover, a police officer posted in Ri Bhoi was also killed during the NGT ban and the perpetrators of the crime are yet to be arrested.
Lack of proper maintenance of road all over the state, perennial  traffic snarl, power shortage, lack of employment opportunities and health care are other concerns , Lanong said.
Expressing concern over the law and order situation in Garo Hills where many policemen were killed, Lanong said that when police personnel themselves are insecure, what would be the plight of the common man."
2306,Central govt not keen on inviting ‘toothless’ HNLC for peace talks,"Monday, April 20, 2015","SHILLONG: The Union government has not been paying any heed to the State government’s eagerness to invite the proscribed Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) for peace talks, as it has received intelligence inputs about the dwindling numbers of cadres of the outfit and its gradual disintegration.
“The State government has written two letters to the Union government expressing to need for peace talks with the HNLC. We have also suggested the need to appoint an interlocutor. But the Centre has not responded to any of the letters,” a senior government official said on Sunday.
According to the senior government official, who did not wish to be named, the Union government has not responded to the State government’s letters since it has received inputs from the Intelligence Bureau (IB) as well as the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) about the dwindling strength of the HNLC.
“As per the intelligence inputs received by the Union government, the outfit does not have enough weapons at its disposal,” the official said.
The official further observed that the there is little incentive for the government to pursue peace talks with a toothless outfit since it would have to spend a lot of money in offering surrendering packages to the outfit members as was the case with regards to the peace pact signed with the Garo Hills-based rebel groups.
Incidentally, Meghalaya Police sources have also corroborated the IB claims and confirmed that there are only 25 senior HNLC members including the ‘general secretary’ and the ‘commander-in-chief’ who are active and still at large.
Most of the top leaders have given up arms and settled down to family life in Bangladesh.
According to the police sources, new recruits do not receive any instruction or training since the HNLC does not have any functional training camp.
The police sources also claimed that junior cadres have to engage themselves with betel nut plantations due to financial crunch within the organization which has become more severe following the NGT ban on coal mining in Meghalaya."
2307,ANVC-B turns to ‘tombola’ to raise funds,"Monday, April 20, 2015","SHILLONG: Following the failure of the Meghalaya government to provide the rehabilitation package as promised eloquently by Chief Minister Mukul Sangma during the signing of the peace pact in September last year, the ANVC-B has decided to organize Bawil-Dawil (tombola with slight modification) to raise funds to look after its cadres.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, the ANVC-B said they were left with no option but to organise this game to sustain themselves after they were betrayed by the State government.
“This is our initiative to sustain our members and also to keep them engaged with some activity so that they are not distracted or forced to return to the jungle out of frustration,” the ANVC-B said, adding, “It is pathetic to resort to such means but we are left with no option.”
“We are unable to face our boys each day and tell them that there is no response from the Government. We are not extorting nor making any demand. We hope this initiative will help us to a certain extent,” the ANVC-B said.
According to the outfit, no help has been coming from the government due to which the young people who came forward to join the mainstream with high hopes are now mostly disappointed. “There is no support and lack of political will have made these young people lose hope,” the ANVC-B said.
The outfit also stated that said that frustration was setting in due to a series of summons, arrests and harassment which the former cadres face at their native places.
“We fear that without proper rehabilitation these youths will be lured away by other militant organizations,” the ANVC-B leaders said.
“The State government must rehabilitate these youths to send a strong message to other organisations or it may just turn out to be the other way round which in the long term cannot be mended,” it added."

CoRP alleged that Dhar Constructions was engaged in mining of boulders along the Umiam River at Nonglum village in Ri Bhoi District and called for immediate closure of all mining activities along the river side to prevent any further destruction of the environment.
Following complaints from local residents about random mining activities along the Umiam River, CoRP conducted a spot inspection of the site led by Samborlang Pdahkasiej and Kiew War, its eastern zone president and vice president, respectively and accompanied by CoRP working president Bandari Ryntathiang and general secretary David Kharnaior along with others.
During the inspection they found that random mining of boulders and collection of sand was underway on the river which was posing potential danger to the ecosystems.
It was alleged that mining along the river side was being carried out with the help of cranes, earth diggers and earth movers.
Surprisingly, during the inspection the CoRP members could not find any machine or mining equipment at the site.
CoRP has decided to pursue the issue and find out whether proper permission was sought for the mining activities and also whether any revenue generated from the quarry was going to the coffers of the Hima or the District Council."

In a statement issued here, Gopal Das, Convener, Forum of BSNL Unions & Associations, NE-I Circle, CTO Complex, said that despite the concerns expressed by the BSNL employees, the company has become the victim of Government policies after the admission of Ravi Shankar Prasad as the Union Minister for Communications.
The company supposedly earned crores of rupees as profit till 2008-09 with the highest being Rs. 10,183 crore in 2004-05. As per Ravi Shankar Prasad, “The way these two PSUs (BSNL and MTNL) have been ill-treated in the last seven years is something to be seen to be believed”.
Anupam Srivastava, CMD of BSNL, further added, “Till 2005, BSNL was the top-most telecom operator. We lost the race after that as our tenders for ‘Capacity Addition’ could not succeed and we were deprived of equipments for adding new customers”.
Currently, BSNL suffers from lack of funds for new equipments.
The reserve funds amounting to more than Rs. 40,000 crore were allegedly taken away by the Central Government on various pleas and in spite of a promise to refund around Rs. 10,000 crore as early as 2010, it has not been met till date."

Coach Thangboi Singto himself acknowledges the fact that the team had their real pre-season during the break which helped in building a stronger side for the second leg.

Young midfielder, Joseph Lalfakzuala was also knocked down during the Mohun Bagan encounter in Kolkata and was left out of the Shillong Derby. Another player missing from the squad is Semilen Doungel as the forward was booked for a double yellow in the Shillong Derby and hence not eligible for the upcoming match against Bharat FC.
Free kick specialist Boithang Haokip who missed the action against Mohun Bagan and Wahingdoh, due to injury will look to make his return in Sunday’s match although the final call on his fitness will be taken before the game. Singto’s troops are heading into Sunday’s clash after playing out a 1-1 draw against Wahingdoh in what was a “heartbreaking” Shillong Derby for the Reds giving away the lead in the last minute.

“We are committed to ensure the enforcement of law despite the limited resources available”, the DGP said.
During the March 25 hearing in Delhi, the NGT had asked the State Government to seek the help of the Union Home Ministry to avail adequate forces to strictly enforce ban on coal mining after there were reports of rampant violation of order. The Chief Secretary was directed to follow up the instructions of NGT on the security aspect.

Defence PRO, Shilong, Group Captain Amit Mahajan said that the EAC does not require any land for developing a golf course.
“The EAC has all the sports facilities that are required and there are no plans to develop anymore and the land in question is required to develop a Disaster Management Centre. The allegations are being leveled by some vested interests against EAC,” Mahajan said.

“The area between the channel and the Air Force wall is not being utilized by the Animal Husbandry Department as it is inaccessible to them,” he said.
The EAC is protecting the catchment area better than anyone else and ensures the conservation of local flora and fauna, he added.
“The EAC campus is full of lush green trees while the outside areas are totally barren and devoid of trees and vegetation,” Mahajan added.

It is pertinent to note that an amount of Rs.49,45,96,111 was disbursed to 291 land owners while an amount of Rs.8 crore has been kept in the custody of the Ri Bhoi deputy commissioner for payment of compensation to those land owners who had not claimed the same.

2335,KSU opposes ‘Govt bid to hand over land to EAC’,"Saturday, April 18, 2015","SHILLONG: The KSU has alleged that the State Government has allotted 18 acres of land which fall under catchment area to the India Air Force for converting it into a golf course.
Opposing the alleged move, the KSU Upper Shillong circle claimed that the decision to allot the land to the Eastern Air Command was taken during the plenary meeting of the Rajya Sabha Board (RJB) chaired by Chief Minister Mukul Sangma on December 4, 2014.
“The land in question belongs to the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department,” KSU Upper Shillong Circle vice president, Shngaiñlang Sohkhlet said while speaking to newsmen here on Friday adding that the Union is surprised by the double-standard adopted by the State Government which talks about acquisition of private land for protection of catchment areas.
Referring to the statement of Forest and Environment Minister, Prestone Tynsong on the plan of the State Government to acquire over 1000 acres of private land under the catchment areas, he said that the minister should be opposing the move since the land which is proposed to be handed over to the defence authorities falls under catchment area.
“We will not allow the Government to hand over this land at any cost. We will not hesitate to agitate if the Government does not reconsider its decision,” Sohkhlet said.
The KSU leader also claimed that the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department has also opposed the proposed move of the government.
“During our meeting with the Deputy Director of the department it was informed that the department too was opposing the plan of the government to give the land which houses the farm of the department and is required for various activities,” the KSU leader said.
Earlier, the Indian Air Force had expressed keen interest in setting up a disaster management centre and required at least 18 acres of land for this purpose. This proposal came up for discussion during the 19th Annual Rajya Sainik Board meeting chaired by the Chief Minister who is also the president of the board.
Rajya Sainik Board secretary, WJB Sturgeon had informed that the Air Force wants to set up the disaster management centre adjacent to the Eastern Air Command’s headquarters in Upper Shillong area."
2336,GNLA’s ‘final warning’ to Tura Civil Hospital,"Saturday, April 18, 2015","TURA: The Garo National Liberation Army (GNLA) has issued a final warning to the authorities of the Tura Civil Hospital to immediately put a stop to the ‘illegal’ collection of parking fees from visitors firmly asserting that it would not accept another explanation.
“Despite the public outcry and complaints from various angles the Civil Hospital authorities have not yet stopped their parking fee collection practice which is illegal.  Instead of rendering service to the sick and the needy they are extorting visitors who come for treatment from all corners of Garo Hills,” the statement issued by G NLA joint publicity secretary, Garo Mandei Ch Marak said.
Downplaying the earlier explanation given by the authorities of the hospital that ‘it was collecting parking fees for the welfare of the patients’ as merely an excuse, the militant leader said that the exact opposite was happening and it was clear from the general opinion of the people that doctors were more interested to attend to their private clinics than to treat the patients while on duty at the hospital.
He said that nowhere in India or the world could one see hospital authorities collecting parking fees from visitors.
“The authorities of Tura Civil Hospital have defied the appeal of the GNLA, the NGOs and public. Now they must put a stop to this illegal practice immediately. We have given them enough time to stop this ill practice, now we don’t want another explanation,” Garo Mandei said.
“We warn hereby that all private clinics in Garo Hills must stop. Only the pharmacies will continue. All government doctors should attend to the sick patients only in the hospitals and not at private clinics run by any proprietor. We have also intel inputs that in many private run clinics adolescent young girls are going for abortions, which is detrimental to the society, the church and for parents and guardians,” the GNLA statement added and warned of action against any medical officer or doctor defying the order."

2339,‘Proper antenatal care can substantially reduce disability’,"Saturday, April 18, 2015","SHILLONG: A large number of children with disabilities in India could have led ordinary lives if only they had received proper antenatal care.
This was the opinion of Dr Andrew Curran, a paediatric neurologist from the UK, who was in Shillong this past week to conduct workshops with teachers and medical professionals, while also meeting disabled and autistic children at an open clinic.
“We know that good antenatal care as received in the West substantially reduces disability in children. So in western society, only 10 per cent of brain damage is caused at birth, the other 90 per cent in the womb, for example through infection, which is no one’s fault,” Dr Curran told The Shillong Times.
In India, however, Dr Curran suspects that the situation is different. Although the figures are not available, “almost all” the children he sees in these clinics, who have severe disabilities, experienced cerebral hypoxia (a reduction in oxygen supply to the brain) at birth due to poor labour care. While not all cases are preventable, a number of them are.
Dr Curran, who has been coming to India once a year for the past six years, said he sees up to 200 children on every trip he makes to the country and he met around two dozen on his visit to Shillong, which was organised at the invitation of Dwar Jingkyrmen.
The teachers who attended the first workshop were taken through a explanation on what could be described as the science of learning – the relationship between the chemicals glutamate and dopamine, which are critical to learning; the development of the brain from infancy onwards; and that age-old stumper: why are teenagers so moody and difficult?
The 20-odd teachers were overwhelmingly positive in their response and the next day saw around 40 medical professionals taken through the brain’s role in muscle movement and ways to manage conditions like spinal muscular atrophy, cerebral palsy and dystonia.
In both workshops, Dr Curran carefully explained the need for inclusion or the mainstreaming of disability, though inclusion is not a panacea.
While pleased with the legislation (Contd on P-7)
Proper antenatal care…
(Contd from P-3) India has passed on issues of people with disabilities, it will take years, he feels, for the mindset of people on the ground to change. Inclusion also has its limits; while most disabled children can be accommodated in mainstream schools, there is still a vital role to be played by special schools.
“In the UK, when inclusion was introduced, it was felt that special schools would not be needed anymore, but we’ve found that that is not true. Yes, the majority of disabled children can go to mainstream schools, but there is a sizeable minority that are not suited to mainstream schools at any level. It leads to children being unhappy and often disruptive to the rest of the class,” Dr Curran said.
Instead, he would like to see continued government support for special schools that are trained to cater to that minority of disabled children.
“Combined with legislation, in five years this would completely transform the experience of disabled children in India,” he opined.
The way that doctors practise paediatrics in India also has some room for improvement, Dr Curran said.
Working with parents helps them cope mentally with the challenges of treating their children, gives doctors a more satisfying experience and ultimately results in better outcomes for the most important people in the process – the children."

2341,Balat haat improves economy of border populace,"Saturday, April 18, 2015","SHILLONG: The border haat located at Balat in East Khasi Hills District is generating a good amount of trade between India and Bangladesh besides playing a pivotal role in improving the economy of the border population.
Functioning since the year 2012, the border haat does a business of Rs 15 lakh every month on an average and goes into business once every week. East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner, Sanjay Goyal said that the haat witnesses a business of Rs 3-4 lakh every week.
While asserting that mostly horticultural and agricultural products are brought to the haat for trade, Goyal pointed out that Haat Management Committee (HMC) reviews the functioning of haat from time to time besides taking various precautions to ensure that it functions according to the law.
Reacting to a query about the measures taken to prevent smuggling in the haat, Goyal said that smuggling of any product is out of the question due to the stringent security measures that have been put in place.
Indian traders sell gingers, bay leaves, oranges, bananas, pineapples, lemons, potatoes, tamarind, black pepper and areca nuts while items such as molasses, brinjal, garlic, sugarcane and  pillows are sold by traders from Bangladesh.
It may be mentioned that the Union Government has also sanctioned a Border Haat at Nalikata along the Indo-Bangla border near Balat in East Khasi Hills District which would start functioning as soon as the infrastructure is ready. There has been a large demand from people residing in border areas to inaugurate similar border haats at different places for upliftment of the economic condition of the border villages."
2342,CBI approached to probe companies’ backgrounds,"Saturday, April 18, 2015","SHILLONG: An FIR was filed before the CBI here to probe the back ground of the companies executing the road project from Jorabat to Barapani amid allegations that there has been destruction of houses and environment during the ‘reckless’ construction process.
In the FIR submitted before the SP,CBI, Shillong, CSWO President Agnes Kharshiing on Friday said that the Jorabat-Barapani road construction undertaken by Concessionaire ILFS Ramkey, under NHAI is now being executed by the NKC Project (P) Ltd and YFC Project (p) Ltd which are unknown companies and seem to have not at all tendered legally as per procedures for the road construction nor were selected under proper procedures strictly laid down which is a clear violation and corruption perpetrated by certain officials in high level.
The FIR also said that it was noticed that the inexperience of the road construction companies have resulted in loss of life and property.  There was a massive landslide in Umling, Ri Bhoi district, on October 5 last year, due to   hazardous blasting and unprofessional road construction which led to the death of a person.
As per the FIR, at least seven cars were trapped under debris, yet the police have mentioned that there were only four cars thereby indirectly helping these companies.
“We were also informed that most of the staffs working in the JCB clearing the debris then were sent away and new JCB drivers and staff were brought in to avoid queries from the people. The road is till date not being properly cleared of the soil and the companies seem to be taking it slow in clearing the debris,” the FIR said.
Kharshiing urged the CBI to have a thorough investigation to ascertain the antecedents of the two companies NKC Project (P) Ltd and YFC Project (P) Ltd, and also probe who had given the contract to them and whether all procedures were followed.
The FIR also mentioned that the CBI should find out how many people actually died in the big landslide at Umling on October 5 and also ascertain the number of cars damaged along with statements of all occupants who were alleged to have escaped the landslide."

2345,"Loss of three lives, Rs 600 crore","Friday, April 17, 2015","SHILLONG: A year of  the interim ban on rat hole coal mining by NGT saw three  deaths , a series of violations of the order and subsequent arrests of drivers of trucks  coupled with loss to the state’ exchequer  to the tune of Rs 600 crore.
Though the next hearing of the NGT was fixed on April 21 in Shillong, it has been postponed to April 30 in Delhi.
It was on April 17 last year that the NGT imposed a sudden ban on the extraction and transportation of already extracted coal thereby bringing to halt large scale unscientific mining.
On September 24 last year, two villagers including a woman were killed and six injured at Mookhep village in East Jaintia Hills in police firing when a mob blocked the National Highway in protest against the arrest of a person from Wapungskur village in connection with the attack on police and the magistrates during the economic blockade against the failure of State Government to address the issues following the ban on coal mining.
After the Government was not satisfied with a magisterial inquiry, the Government recently instituted an administrative inquiry to probe the incident.
Again in a related incident, on January 24 night this year, Sub Inspector  P J Marbaniang, the officer  in charge of Patharkhmah police outpost died mysteriously after he detained 32 trucks carrying coal illegally to Assam.
An inquiry on the matter was taken up by the Special Investigation Team.
Despite the ban, violations still continue in parts of Jaintia Hills.
After  the  Principal Bench of NGT in Delhi  warned action against police personnel during a hearing  on March 20, the Additional DGP  YC Modi who was present collapsed in the Tribunal premises, which prompted the green court to postpone the hearing.
The intention of NGT was aimed at environment protection, but the end result will be visible only once there is adherence to complete ban as already there are reports of fresh extraction of coal in parts of State.
When contacted on the enforcement of law, the Meghalaya DGP  Rajiv Mehta on Thursday said that the police are making best efforts to take action against the violators of NGT ban. “We are acting with available resources with us”, Mehta said.
A coal baron who did not wish to be quoted said that sufficient time should have been given before the NGT resorted to ban on coal mining.
“The ban came like a bolt from the blue. And we were not prepared for it. If sufficient deadline of six  months  or one year would have been given to us to make corrective steps before banning , this would have been ideal”, he said.
He further added that the economy of the state was affected due to the sudden ban and it is not only the State Government which is facing financial hardships, but also the villagers in and around mining sites, workers, coal dealers and owners who directly or indirectly depend on coal mining activities.
Besides the loss of revenue, the Government, the coal dealers and owners who have filed appeals against the NGT ban are spending crores of rupees for the lawyers.
A legal expert from the state said those affected due to the NGT ban for the last one year should have been provided with some rehabilitation package.
Moreover, sufficient time for those who depend on coal mining activities should have been given by the NGT before imposing ban on coal mining as it has affected their livelihood and economic activities.
“With the revenue loss of Rs 600 crore, the circulation of money has been affected due to the NGT ban”, he said.
As a solution, the legal expert pointed out that in the long run, the miners will have to obtain license under the Mines and Minerals Development and  Regulation  Act , 1957 to carry out mining legally and scientifically .
Moreover a mining plan by the State Government as agreed  upon by the Centre  will ensure that the NGT withdraws the ban.
The mining plan is aimed at restoration of water bodies, checking air pollution while mining and adoption of proper safeguards for the protection of environment and the workers.
The legal expert further pointed out that even the exemption of traditional mining practices from the purview of the ban will not bring out any desired result as NGT and Supreme Court will insist proper regulation to ensure safety of environment and human beings.
Status of Mining  Plan:      Mining scheme is under preparation after State Government submitted the proposal to the Secretary, Ministry of Coal  and to the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests on July 23,2014
Ministry of Coal constituted  Expert Group led by the Central Mine Planning & Design Institute Ltd to prepare broad guidelines for the mining of coal."

Sources said that the primary target of these eight legislators is the Chief Minister and the complaint lodged against the cabinet ministers with the state party chief was just an addition as the aggrieved legislators did not want to show that they are targeting the Chief Minister alone.
Ronnie Lyngdoh had defended the Government when the motion against the Speaker AT Mondal was brought  in the  Assembly during the Budget session .
However, this is the first time that he is expressing his resentment over the style and functioning of the Chief Minister.

Sources said that the issue was already conveyed to the High Command after the matter was first brought before the MPCC President.
Meanwhile, a day after eight MLAs lodged a complaint with MPCC over the absence of Chief Minister and some ministers, the working president of Congress Deborah Marak has urged the Ministers to attend the office regularly as and when they are in Shillong.
“I feel every Minister should attend the office anyhow when he or she is in Shillong,” Marak said on Thursday.

Early morning customers were charged the old rates for both petrol and diesel at the Assam Oil Corporation station at Hawakhana despite other stations in the town adhering to the new slashed prices.
“When I filled up my car to head to school I was charged the old price for petrol. When I questioned the fuel attendant I was told that they were yet to receive the notification. I had to refill at a higher rate and it was a similar     experience for many more,” complained Tyrone D’Brass, aggrieved headmaster of a renowned school in Tura.
There were many more who received a similar response from the pump attendants.
Petrol in Tura was slashed by Re.0.82 from a high of Rs.60.11 to Rs.59.29 while diesel price was reduced by Rs.1.34 from Rs.49.57 to Rs.48.26.
Incidentally, while the AOC station was continuing to charge at the old rate, other fuel stations of the town were abiding by the new rates which immensely benefitted the customers.
Ironically, by afternoon it was found that the AOC station at Hawakhana had also slashed their prices although the damage had already been done and someone had allegedly profited in the midnight drop in fuel prices."

Kharkrang said there has been   substantial increase in intake of drugs that has direct connection to the crimes specially related to property viz. theft, robbery, burglary and dacoity.
He pointed out that the total number of cases reported under NPDS Act during 2009-2014 in East Khasi Hills District was 55. 63 people were arrested under the NPDS Act from 2010-2014.
About 600 school students attended the programme which was organised by the East Khasi Hills Police to educate students on how not to fall prey later in life and that they grow up to be assets and not liabilities of society.
In the last two years, such programmes were organised for college students but this year the district police has decided to ‘catch them young’ by imbibing in them the spirit to abide by the law from an early age."

According to Lapang, the party legislators recently handed over the official letter requesting him to address the problem faces by them in his capacity as the party president.

2374,Tara Ghar to function as State guesthouse,"Thursday, April 16, 2015","SHILLONG: After formally notifying the conversion of Tara Ghar, a former official residence of several chief ministers of Meghalaya into a State Guest House in August last year, the State government is contemplating to formally inaugurate the State Guest House by June this year.
“We have completed the renovation work of Tara Ghar. We would start the furnishing work once we get the sanction from the government,” State Estate Officer L. Shabong informed here on Wednesday.
According to him, they have proposed a total amount of Rs.37.39 lakh for the furnishing work.
Meanwhile, he said that as part of the renovation work, they have replaced the old wooden planks with floor tiles adding that they have also re-painted the whole bungalow.
It may be mentioned that Meghalaya does not have an official guest house since the Brightwell Bungalow at Barik Point, which earlier functioned as the State guest house, was converted into an official residence for ministers and legislators.
It may be mentioned that the Brightwell House was first occupied by late F.A. Khonglam during his tenure as the chief minister.
The bungalow was then occupied  by H.D.R. Lyngdoh and Bindo Mathew Lanong during their tenure as minister and deputy chief minister, respectively. The bungalow is now being occupied by former Assembly Speaker Martin M Danggo.

The woman, Stela Dkhar, alleged that the Rangbah Shnong, along with a group of people from the village, illegally and forcibly claimed right of ownership over her land.
On Wednesday, members of the Jaintia Students’ Union along with media persons went to the village and found that the land holding certificates issued by the JHADC Revenue department to Stela Dkhar indicate that she owns two plots of land – one located at Skum Sniang measuring 31,698 sq.mt. substantiated with LHC No. 24 issued in 1993 and another plot of land at Pahein Thwai Longdung measuring 10,702 hectares which was substantiated by Patta No. 8836 issued by the JHADC.
“Despite having all documents to prove my ownership over these properties, a group of people from the village led by the Rangbah Shnong are claiming the land for themselves,” Stela Dkhar said.
Stela’s daughter, S. Charity Dkhar, also informed that a plot of land ‘Madan Kymprup’ which was gifted by her mother to her was also being claimed by the headman and his coterie. She produced a LHC issued by the JHADC in 1997 as proof of ownership over the land measuring 8100 sq.mts.
Apart from this, another plot of land belonging to her brother, S. Lakhonty Dkhar, had also been forcibly taken over by the headmen.
The two women claimed that the headman had misused his powers and forcibly claimed the properties.
“The Rangbah Shnong and his family members including his MDC brother have been attempting to usurp the property since 2011,” Stela Dkhar informed, while recalling that in April, 2011, the Presiding Officer, Sub-ordinate District Council Court, Jowai, had passed an ad-interim injunction order restrained the headman and his people from entering into the property under suit.
Again in November, 2014, another ad-interim injunction order was passed by the same court in connection with another plot of land own by the Dkhar family.
The family claimed that the headmen and his group have acted in blatant violation of the court orders.
“Few days ago, we were working on the suited property when a group of people led by the headman illegally entered into the property owned by us and uprooted all the boundary pillars and destroyed all the demarcations dug as boundaries.
Meanwhile, another woman, Dita Phawa, also claimed that the same headman had been attempting to grab her plot of land. “I was working on my land when suddenly the headman along with his relative Pynhun Rymbai of Mukhla village came and threatened me with dire consequences,” Phawa said.
The woman had lodged a complaint with Ummulong Police in this regard on Friday last."

As per the 2011 census, out of a total of 5, 38, 299 households in the State, 34.3 per cent still practice open defecation. Mewhile, the percentage of rural household practicing open defecation in the State is 43.1 per cent whereas in urban areas it is 2.4 per cent.
The census also highlighted that the percentage of households not having latrines was 37.1 per cent in 2011 and the average of toilet coverage in schools in Meghalaya stood at only 67 per cent.

The bio-digester is an innovative technology developed by the Defence Research & Development Organization (DRDO) mainly to cater to the needs of soldiers in high altitude zones. Seeing the success of the project, the DRDO further refined the technology and identified several technology providers for its wider dissemination in the country. (Contd on P-10)

2389,Guv’s absence prolongs KHADC stalemate,"Wednesday, April 15, 2015","SHILLONG: With Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi having his hands full vis-à-vis managing four states of West Bengal, Bihar, Meghalaya and Mizoram, the political parties, pressure groups and others in the State are finding it difficult to meet him for redressal for their various issues.
Meghalaya has not had a permanent Governor for three months now.
It was on January 6 this year that Tripathi was sworn in as the Governor of Meghalaya, but by that time, he was already holding the post in West Bengal and Bihar.
Later, on April 4 Tripathi was sworn in as the Governor of Mizoram.
The last time Tripathi visited Meghalaya was during the budget session to address the House on March 9.
Since the Governor has been out of station, there is uncertainty over the affairs of the KHADC as the All Regional Party’s Alliance (ARPA), which is claiming majority in the House, is waiting for his arrival to reiterate its demand to hold a special session to prove its majority.
Earlier on March 9, both the Government and the Opposition had met the Governor separately making claims and counter claims regarding the political crisis in the KHADC.
Moreover, there is uncertainty over the decision of the State Cabinet to impose Administrator’s Rule in KHADC after the Governor expressed reservation on the matter.
Though the Cabinet reiterated its decision, the Governor is yet to make his stand known to the government.
Meanwhile, ARPA has decided to wait for the Governor’s decision on the fresh recommendation of the state government for imposition of Administrator’s Rule in the KHADC.
“At the moment, we have decided to wait for the Governor’s decision,” ARPA chairman Metbah Lyngdoh said after an emergent meeting of the alliance MDCs on Tuesday.
He also said that the ARPA MDCs will meet the Governor whenever he arrives in the State and impress upon him the need to convene a special session for election of the new Chief Executive Member (CEM) of the KHADC.
Asked if they have taken any decision regarding approaching the court to appeal     against the state government’s decision, Lyngdoh said that the situation does not warrant such extreme steps.
“We are confident that the Governor will judiciously apply his mind before taking a final call on the matter,” the ARPA chairman said.
To a query on whether the Governor had accepted the resignation of Adelbert Nongrum as the CEM, Lyngdoh said that as per his information, there has been no official communiqué from the Governor Secretariat on the acceptance of the resignation."

2391,Five hurt in LPG blast in Tura town,"Wednesday, April 15, 2015","TURA: Five persons were severely injured in a LPG cylinder blast at Tura Main Market near Police Parade Ground on Tuesday morning.
The incident took place in the makeshift kitchen of a tea stall owned by one Shubir Mahanto (45) in which a mother along with her two daughters, a co-worker and a minor roadside vegetable vendor were injured.
Four of the victims have been identified as Manju Devi (45), her two daughters Robita Kumari (16) and Ranjani Kumari (15) and Sourab Ali (15), while the identity of the minor vegetable vendor who is also said to be the most critical is yet to be established.
According to Ravi Kumar (18), son of Manju Devi, the incident took place at around 7:30 am while his mother and two sisters who work at the tea stall were beginning to brew the morning’s tea for customers.
The minor vegetable vendor who had kept his merchandise in the kitchen of the tea stall for the night had also gone in to bring them out to start the day’s business.  As the mother and the two daughters were engrossed in their work a leaking LPG cylinder kept below in the makeshift kitchen began to catch fire. Seeing the danger, Sourab Ali, a co-worker, managed to drag the cylinder out of the kitchen and fled to escape the full force of the blast but sustained considerable injuries.
The mother and her two daughters including the vegetable vendor also tried to flee but were caught in the blast.
“The leaking gas must have been ignited by the kerosene stove being used by the mother and her two daughters as we saw a white streak trailing down from where they were working to the kitchen below,” Prebun Ch Marak, a driver and an eyewitness at the scene said.
Meanwhile, West Garo Hills Deputy Commissioner Pravin Bakshi, when contacted, informed that all the five injured people have been taken to Guwahati for treatment."
