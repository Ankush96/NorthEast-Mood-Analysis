"1","Protest Demanding Arrest of Army Personnel Accused of Rape","August 13","A large number of activists, students and Northeast people protested on Wednesday in front of Assam Bhawan in New Delhi under the banner of North-East Forum for International Solidarity (NEFIS) condemning the alleged gang rape of a pregnant woman by the army personnel in Assam’s Kokrajhar district on Sunday night. NEFIS demanded immediate arrest of the accused army personnel. A press release from NEFIS informed that eminent activist Maya John of Centre for Struggling Women too joined the protest and pointed out the role of AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) in granting impunity to the armed forces personnel, “who have been abusing the people of North-East.” She pointed out that women are the most vulnerable victims, facing brutal exploitation such as rape. The release noted that AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) is imposed in various districts of Assam under which Army officers have legal immunity for their actions. “There are serious chances of putting even this rape case under the carpet as done earlier,” it expressed. “Police cannot take any action against the perpetrators unless the Home Ministry gives permission for the same.” It asserted that such provisions clearly stand against common masses. NEFIS also warned that it will take the issue further in the coming days if the government does not immediately arrest the perpetrators and take action against them."
"2","Bicycle Bomb Alert in Assam","August 13","Security agencies in Assam have been put on maximum alert following inputs suggesting that militants, particularly those belonging to the UILFA-I, may use petty criminals or linkmen to explode bombs concealed in bicycles ahead of Independence Day. “Intelligence inputs indicate that militant outfits, particularly the anti-talk faction of ULFA, is likely to plant IEDs in bicycles for causing explosion,” a WT message circulated by the Assam Police headquarters to all police stations said. “They are likely to outsource (the work to) petty criminals,” it added. “There have been instances of using cycles and vehicles to plant IEDs in busy areas in the past too,” Director General of Police Khagen Sarma said. He said that besides the anti-talk faction of Ulfa and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), there were reports of Islamists also trying to carry out disruptive activities ahead of August 15. “We have observed movements of Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jamaat-ul Mujahiddin ultras besides Ulfa and NDFB. Though the Islamic groups have not indulged in any sabotage in the State so far, there are some boys from the State who had received training under them,” Sarma said. ADGP (special branch) Pallab Bhattacharyya said the threat has been there since quite some time. “There was an input from central agencies that some ISI-backed groups organized a meeting in Bangladesh recently following which cadres were pushed inside India. This coupled with sightings of a man – who had reportedly joined the Lashkar-e-Toiba – in Assam after a gap of about ten/ fifteen years have raised apprehensions of a possible attack,” the police official said, asking people to be alert. Assam CM Tarun Gogoi, who chaired a security review meeting today, said the police machinery has been asked to be alert even after Independence Day. “Due to the beefed-up security, the militants may opt to strike a day or two after Independence Day,” he said. Guwahati DCP (traffic) Pranabjyoti Goswami said all the vehicles entering Guwahati are being frisked. “A 24*7 vigil is being maintained at the entry points of the city,” he said. A man hunt has been also launched in hotels, guest houses and other possible places of hide-outs. Like every year, militant groups in Assam have called for a boycott of the Independence Day celebrations and a general strike that day. -Tsnl"
"3","ABSU Demonstration in New Delhi for Bodoland","August 13","The All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) on Wednesday staged a three-hour demonstration at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi demanding creation of a separate Bodoland state, supported by the National Federation for New States, an umbrella forum demanding separate states in the country. The protesters raised banners and placards and shouted slogans “We want Bodoland” and “Divide Assam 50/50″. A memorandum was submitted to Prime minister Narendra Modi by various organisations, including Absu, Kuki State Demand Committee, Bharatiya Gorkha Pari-sangh, Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura, Joint Action Committee for Autonomous State, People’s Joint Action Committee for Bor-oland Movement, Joint Action Committee for Dimaraji Movement, Vidarbha Connect, and the NDFB (Progressive). The organisations stressed the need to create smaller states and urged the Centre to adopt a policy towards facilitating to create more new states. This, the protesters said, would fulfil the long-standing aspirations of the people for faster growth and development on all fronts and ensure equal status, rights and opportunities. “There should be a concrete national policy for creation of new states, specifically for the Northeast, and another policy for the rest of the country,” said Absu president Pramod Boro. The organisations urged the Centre to formulate a concrete policy to create new states for all the regions wherever such demands crop up. The memorandum said autonomous councils had not been able to address the problems of different eth-nic communities and therefore, creation of separate states was the only solution. The issue of demanding smaller states was also raised during a national seminar – Perspectives and Realisation on the Issues of Smaller States in India – held yesterday at Mavlanakar Hall of Constitution Club, New Delhi, where the agitators resolved to come together and intensify their statehood movements. “Based on the suggestions of the experts, the organisers of the seminar will launch a movement for creation of new states,” Boro said. -TT"
"4","Illegal Migration; Rajnath Singh to Visit Bangladesh Border in Assam","August 12","Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh will visit the Bangladesh border in Assam within this month to take stock of the situation arising out of illegal migration. “Within this month, after August 15 and before August 30, I will visit Assam and tour the Bangladesh border to see the situation there,” Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday at a seminar on “30 years of the Assam accord: Issues, challenges and implementation” organised by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU). An AASU delegation will accompany the home minister on his trip to the border areas. Rajnath Singh said the government would do everything possible for the full implementation of the Assam Accord that was signed on August 15, 1985, between the Centre, the Assam government, AASU and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad to end a six-year-long movement in protest against illegal migration. Paying tributes to the martyrs of the Assam agitation, Rajnath Singh said: “I know about all your genuine demands and I can assure you that only Indians will stay in India. We should know what steps should be taken to protect the rights of the indigenous people without leaving any loopholes.” The home minister said discussions will be held with AASU to find out the shortcomings in the Assam Accord that are stopping its full implementation. He said work on updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam was being done under the direct supervision of the Supreme Court. “Since I became the home minister last year, I have visited Assam as many as seven times. This is the most visits I have made to any state after my home state of Uttar Pradesh,” Rajnath Singh said, adding that the government was committed to solving all problems of Assam. Youth Affairs and Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who is also a former AASU president, said that though the accord will complete 30 years on August 15, many clauses have still not been implemented. “The main aim of the Assam Accord was to stop illegal migration and safeguard the identity of the indigenous people,” Sonowal said. “We will not stay silent and I will work for the full implementation of the accord.” Sonowal requested the home minister to take steps so that illegal migration does not take place in areas like Karimganj in the Barak Valley and Dhubri in the Brahmaputra Valley. “I request the home minister to visit the border areas with an AASU delegation so that necessary steps can be taken,” he said."

"9","Meghalaya HC Quashes Warrants Against CMJ Officials","August 13","The High Court of Meghalaya has set aside the order of arrest issued by the Chief Judicial Magistrate against the two sons of CMJ University Chancellor CM Jha, Govind Jha and Gopal Jha who are the trustee members of the University. Recently, the single bench of the High Court had set aside the dissolution order of CMJ issued by the State Government. Hearing a criminal petition, the Chief Justice Uma Nath Singh in his order on Wednesday said that there was blatant abuse of process of court on the part of the then Chief Judicial Magistrate B Joshi  in passing the orders dated 04.08.2014 and 08.09.2014 in CID case No.2(4)/2013. While the order dated 04.08.2014 refers to non-bailable warrants issued against the sons of Jha with a directions to handcuff them, the order dated  08.09.2014 relates to proclaiming them as absconders under Section 82 CrPC. by the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate. The High Court observed that the accused including CM Jha (alleged to be the main accused), have been granted bail and there is no complaint that any of them has misused the liberty so granted. Besides, ND Chullai, senior Government Advocate, made a specific statement that in view of the fact that the charge-sheet has been filed, the petitioners (sons of Jha) were no more required to appear before the Investigating Officer. “Thus, to secure the ends of justice, these orders cannot be sustained in law and have to be quashed and set aside. Hence, I order accordingly. Consequently, all such proceedings that arise out of the orders 30 dated 04.08.2014 and 08.09.2014 alleged to be pending with the police and before the court shall also not survive any further. Inevitably, these proceedings shall terminate forthwith”, the Court said The Chief Justice further added that the petitioners, Govind and  Gopal should not be arrested or called for interrogation or subjected to any kind of pressure, harassment and fear of arrest by the police in connection with CID case. Regarding hurried action taken against the University, the Court said that on 26.04.2013, all of a sudden the Deputy Secretary to the Governor of Meghalaya, sought lots of information, particularly, with regard to the admission of students within 3 days by 29.04.2013 from the Sponsor. However, without waiting for the reply sought by the Deputy Secretary to the Governor, the  Principal Secretary to the Governor directed the Director General of Police, Meghalaya to conduct investigation into the functioning of the University and launch criminal proceedings if investigation revealed commission of criminal offence against the University. After receiving letter from the Principal Secretary to the Governor, the State CID registered the case on the same day (26.04.2013). Analyzing various aspects related to CMJ University, the High Court made it clear that the checking the cases of mismanagement, maladministration are within the domain of the State Government and not that of the Visitor who is the Governor of Meghalaya.  Section 48 (2) of the Act makes it clear that, “On identification of mismanagement, maladministration, indiscipline, failure in the accomplishment of the objectives of University and economic hardships in the management systems of University, the State Government would issue directions to the management system of the University. If the directions are not followed within such time as may be prescribed, the right to take decision for winding up of the University would vest in the State Government.” -TST"
"10","Meghalaya: Girl Rescued After Sexually Abused for over 24 Days","August 12","A minor girl of 16 years was illegally confined and forced to sleep with different men in a case that hints at human trafficking.The 16 year old girl was rescued on Monday by her family after 24 days of being waylaid and kidnapped. The accused, Jinjin D Shira (38 years), has been handed over to the police after the family set up an elaborate plan to nab Shira and rescue their daughter. “When she did not return home till late in the evening on July 17, we searched for her in the locality and informed our relatives. Left with no other option, we filed a missing report at Tura police station”, the victim’s family said. According to her own admission, the girl was lured by Jinjin who later confined her to a house in a locality on the outskirts of Tura, West Garo Hills (WGH). She was forced to drink and forced to sleep with different men every day since the ordeal started. “I was forced to drink and have sexual intercourse with multiple partners every day”, said the 16 year old after being rescued. The victim’s family later said that their daughter was taken to different localities within Tura town every day and was left alone with men, who had exploited her physically. While the family frenetically searched for their daughter, all their initial efforts came to naught. However, a breakthrough came when a person informed the family that the girl was seen with Jinjin. They then made an elaborate plan to rescue their daughter and nab her kidnapper. “We opened a fake account on Facebook pretending to be a young boy and started our conversation with Jinjin. We started our talks on whether she can provide any girls. She informed that she has a young girl and after an agreement on money, we would be allowed to spend a night with this girl”, a family member said. After a few days the ploy seemingly worked when Shira confirmed that she could bring a young girl to a locality in Tura. “We asked her to bring the girl and later rescued her on Monday evening”, victim’s father said. After being caught, Shira confessed to her crime and was later handed over to the Tura police station. The police have registered a case under section 66A, 342, 368/34 of IPC for wrongful confinement and kidnapping. The case is being handled by Tura women police cell. “We have applied the section based on the FIR which was filed earlier by the family. We will record the detailed statement of the victim and their family and apply an appropriate section”, said the Superintendent of Police (SP) of WGH, Mukesh Singh. Shira was produced in the Court on Tuesday and sent to seven days police custody. -MT"
"11","Fury over Village Administration Bill","August 11","July Edition NET Bureau, Sandeep Chatterjee Meghalaya has always been politically interesting; be it the toppling of governments or tussles for the chief ministerial seat. The state has always managed to keep political watchers up on their heels. Here is a look at the latest from the state’s coffer – the Village Administration Bill, which has caused quite a furor. The traditional system of governance is deeply rooted to the Khasi way of life. The recent questioning of its authority by the high court, has led many a people to rethink about the status of traditional governing bodies of the state. The traditional bodies – known as dorbars draw its roots since the age of the kings before democracy had any relevance in the state. But with time even the dorbars moulded itself with the changing times, from monarchy to democracy. Today, it exists parallel to the democratic design of the state but how relevant is its existence is the question of the hour. Since ages now the dorbars have been executing their duties of looking after the localities at a micro level. Though not constitutionally recognized, yet these dorbars have relentlessly worked for the uplift of the society for many years now. Deeply knitted with the Khasi traditions, culture and roots, it is also regarded as an institution that safeguards and archives the fast depleting cultural values in today’s world. Be it any funeral or marriage, water scarcity or garbage disposal, youth development or law and order; the durbars can be best described as the stepping stones of governance in Meghalaya. In contemporary times, it works hand in hand with the government and constitutional institutions in implementation and check of various schemes. And above all, the durbars function with neither any financial assistance nor managerial assistance from the government. For many years now this system was going on smoothly until the recent high court’s question on the source of dorbar’s authority. It is true that India is a democracy and the functioning of dorbars more or less attributes to monarchy but it also stands true that the dorbars have nothing but helped the government in its functioning. With questions being raised on its authority the whole state has turnedin to constitutionally recognise the authority of the dorbars. However, there has become a divide among these people as the Village Administration Bill seems to be, according to some quarters, is drawn by sentiments rather than proper research and consultation. The state is now divided as the association of the headmen, Rangbah Shnong, the district councils and the government has locked horns regarding the contents of the Bill. “No doubt, the Bill is required but its contents have to be scrutinised. Some of its contents are uncommon and confusing as it is drawn through sentiments and lacks proper research, therefore, we believe it should be redrafted properly so that everyone benefits from it,” said Bindo M Lanong, working president of the United Democratic Party. For the people it is all hay wire, as there are many who have not yet understood the problem and reason of all these commotion. The state has seen it all shutdowns, public gathering, hunger strike and so on which has compelled the government to rethink about the bill. The Bill, which has been passed by the district council was sent back by the government for reconsideration as some of the sections and clauses, according to the government, needed to be deleted. However, the council and the association of the headmen are for its immediate acceptance by the government without any changes. The Village Administration Bill was first introduced in the state when the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, Government of India sent the draft Meghalaya Village Council Act 2011 to the state government with a request for its approval and implementation. Based on lines closer to the Panchayati Raj system, this bill aimed at strengthening the democratic process in the state. However, the district councils unanimously chose to oppose the enactments as they felt contrary to the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and to the prevailing traditional practices, customs and the usages of the tribal communities of the state. Therefore, in response to this the Executive Committee of Khasi Hills District Autonomous Council constituted its own Village Administration Bill 2011 which was passed in the summer of 2014. “The bill is absolutely fine, there is no confusion, but still the government is delaying to pass it on the floor of the house. I fail to understand their dilemma, may be they are not committed to the cause,” says Michael Syiemiong, an active member of one of the dorbars in the state. It is true that the non-functioning of dorbars for quite some time now has taken its toll among the residents of different localities. And the noncooperation by the dorbars with the government until they resolve to pass the Bill is nothing but harassing the common men in the end. It is the common men who are bearing the brunt of this tussle between the government, ADCs and the traditional bodies over the Village Administration Bill. There is some respite for the state as the bill now rests with the Governor and the people are hopeful that he will take steps in favour of the betterment of the state and its people. Even the traditional institutions have shown some trust on the Governor and called-off all their agitations till the Governor comes up with anything concrete. But come what may the council and the traditional bodes are bent on the passing of the Bill. “We want the turmoil in the state to end soon. The dorbars are important to us; it has been here for so many years now. The government should sort out the matter soon and give the durbars their due”, Nachiketa Roy, a resident of Laban, said. Whatever be the cause, the solution to this problem needs to be sought soon. The common man is feeling the heat with continuous protests and the trademark shutdowns of the state. All eyes are now on the Governor to take a step in the right direction. As for the state it still awaits its long-practiced traditions to be recognised by the democracy."
"12","Meghalaya: Pregnant Doctor Fired for Seeking Maternity Leave","August 11","In what can be termed as shocking and inhumane act, a doctor working under contract basis in Dr. H Gordan Robert hospital in Shillong, Meghalaya was allegedly terminated from service after she applied for maternity leave.

"13","Manipur Student Leaders Released Ahead of Talks on ILP","August 13","Manipur Government on Wednesday released seven leaders of All Manipur Students’ Union (AMSU) after being detained for weeks on the charge of stirring up ILP agitation. The Government freed them without any condition. Joint Committee on Inner Line Permit System (JCILPS), which has been spearheading the ILP movement in Manipur, had threatened to cancel the second round of talks with the Government if the student leaders were not released by 3 pm on Wednesday. The first meeting between representatives of the Joint Committee and Government took place on August 10.  The Joint Committee has recommended five key points to insert them in a new ILP Bill being prepared by a Government constituted Drafting Committee. The five points are issue of pass or permit to migrants, fixation of 1951 as the cut-off base year in demographic influx into the state, no land ownership rights to all non-indigenous people, strengthening of the Labour Department for registration and regulation of inter-state migrant labourers, and detection and pushing back of illegal migrants. It has also given a deadline to the Government to introduce the new Bill by August 15. But the Government had informed the Joint Committee during the first round of talks that the Bill was yet to be finalized. Besides, the Joint Committee is demanding the Manipur Government to award stringent punishment to all cops responsible for the death of Sapam Robonhood, a class 11 student. He died in police crackdown during ILP agitation on July 8. Since then his body is still lying unclaimed at the mortuary of Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS) in Imphal East. The youth was a resident of Khurai Lairikyengbam Leikai in Imphal East, which is the epicenter of the ILP agitation. On March 15 this year, Manipur Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh introduced a Manipur Regulation of Visitors, Tenants and Migrant Workers’ Bill 2015′ (MRVTMW Bill 2015), which was passed by the House on March 16. But it was later withdrawn by the Government after intense public pressure. JCILPS had said the MRVTMW Bill 2015 only aimed at protecting the interests of non-locals and not the indigenous people. Sit-ins and rallies continued in various parts of the valley on Wednesday to demand implementation of Inner Line Permit system. A medical helpline opened by JCILPS yesterday said more than 250 pro-ILP activists were injured during ILP agitation in the last one month. -MExN"
"14","Court to Record Sharmila’s Statement on 6th October","August 12","A Delhi court on Wednesday set October 6 as the date for recording the statement of Manipuri activist Irom Sharmila in a case related to her allegedly attempting suicide during her fast-unto-death at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi in 2006. Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain, who was scheduled to record Sharmila’s statement, deferred it for the next date as she was not produced before the court by Manipur Police. The court had on June 6 concluded recording of evidence by the prosecution and posted the matter for recording of Sharmila’s statement under section 313 of CrPC. 42-year-old Sharmila is on a fast for over 14 years in Manipur demanding repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). Sharmila had earlier told the court that she was very much eager to eat if she got the assurance that the “draconian” act will be revoked.  The court on March 4, 2013, framed charges against Sharmila, popularly known as the “Iron Lady”, for attempting to commit suicide and put her on trial after she refused to plead guilty."
"15","Manipur Child Rights Panel Asks Govt not to Abuse School Children","August 12","The Manipur Commission for Protection of Child Rights (MCPCR) has asked the security forces not to adopt widespread, systemic and institutionalized physical abuse and create psychological damage of the young people that will have a long lasting negative impact on their future life. Members of MCPCR K Maharabi Singh in an appeal issued on Tuesday said young girls and boys below 18 years are the main protestors of the present movement demanding introduction of Inner Line Permit to check illegal influx. As a matter of fact the very interpretation of “Minimum Force” needs to be redefined and reviewed contextually. For that matter, lathicharge, tear gas, shells and rubber bullets should not be used arbitrarily and abruptly against the unarmed children, and ordering to use such dangerous and deadly means as minimum force without justifiable ground realities against the unarmed young children is unwarranted it was added. If required, the security forces should use other less injurious means such as repeated convincing warning through loud speaker, ensuring adequate barricades, water cannon may be an option as last resort, while encountering the young children. The proportionate force to their tender age and their probable strength should be taken into consideration before resorting any violent means. There should be always arrangements for ambulance and first aid along the side of such confrontation, it was further added. The underlying principle is – our security forces and police should be rather children friendly and Protective Force rather than hostile force unleashing devastating impact to right to life and the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly. Excessive and disproportionate use of force on children and young students is unbecoming in a democratic country like India, a country which ratified the UN Convention on Rights of the Child and where Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 is in force. The Section 23 ((Punishment for cruelty to juvenile or child) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 states that ” Whoever, having actual charge of, control over, a juvenile or the child, assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile or causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned, exposed or neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile or the child unnecessary mental or physical suffering shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or fine, or with both.” Further, The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules,2007 Rule No. 84 (11) also provides that – “Any police officer found guilty, after due enquiry, of torturing a child, mentally or physically, shall be liable to be removed from service, besides being prosecuted for the offence.” The Commission also appealed to all the stake holders to treat Educational Institutions and Education as an Essential Service and exempt it from closure. -UNI"

"17","Nagaland Cong Legislators Prepared to Sacrifice Their Position","August 13","The eight Congress legislators of Nagaland state on Wednesday asserted that they along with the remaining members of the Nagaland Legislative Assembly are prepared to “sacrifice” their position for peace and a lasting solution. A joint statement from the 8 Congress legislators further said that they have not joined the government on their own volition, “but on the endorsement of the PCC Executive, office bearers and PAC meeting held on March 9, and therefore have not breached any party discipline in the first place.” The statement was appended by Congress legislators SI Jamir, Tokheho Yepthomi, C Apok Jamir, S Hukavi Zhimomi, Dr Imtwapang Aier, Imtikumzuk, Eshak Konyak and K Khekaho Assumi. They said that a few disgruntled leaders may have “poisoned the ears of the AICC leaders” and are “hell bent on obstructing any constructive measures taken by the CLP in the interest of the people.” They also claimed that neither the AICC nor the NPCC had issued any official directive to the CLP members asking not to join the government or to oppose it during the recently concluded budget session. The 8 legislators stated that they came to know of the directive only through the media. While hitting out at the NPCC President, K Therie, the 8 legislators called for a stop in “attempts to derive cheap political mileage to stay relevant in state politics.” Affirming that they are still congressmen, the legislators stated that they have not given up membership of the party and were suspended on the “ill advice of some leaders with vested interest.” “It is for the people to judge the present political developments. Had not the Congress rescued the present government during its worst internal party crisis, the state would have been landed into political uncertainty, even to the extent of facing imposition of Presidents Rule, which would have been detrimental to the interest of the people and mainly on the ongoing Naga Political dialogue,” they said. The legislators stated that the “unique composition” of the NLA, along with the formation of the NLF and the PWG have “lobbed the ball back into the court of the central government to hasten the process of finding an early settlement to the Naga political issue.” -MExN"
"18","Muivah: Nagas Must Understand Each Other, Repent & Forgive Each Other","August 13","NSCN (IM) general secretary and political negotiator, Thuingaleng Muivah, on Wednesday sought to allay apprehension on the recently signed ‘framework agreement’ and underlined “peaceful co-existence” between the Indian Union and Naga people as the core principle of the framework. Muivah arrived Dimapur, Nagaland along with members of his council of kilonsers to attend the 69th Independence Day celebration at Camp Hebron on August 14. The general secretary is also expected to hold meetings with Naga civil societies and other stakeholders to discuss the ‘framework agreement.’ The NSCN leader, addressing a civic reception organized by Naga Hoho from a bullet proof enclosure, said the NSCN (IM) entered into political talks only after India accepted these three points: recognizing the uniqueness of Naga history that Nagas were never under India, that Nagas did not kill any Indian civilian in the course of the struggle for self determination and the universal principle that in democracy, sovereignty lies with the people. “In the history of Nagas, we have never been offered these points, only this time. Therefore, we are confident that it would provide an enduring, inclusive and new relationship of peaceful co-existence of two entities-Nagas and Indians,” Muivah stated. Accordingly, he pointed out that both the parties reached the Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015 for an honorable solution for sharing of sovereign powers between the India Union and the Naga people to be defined in the competencies. Muivah reminded that it took 18 long years for the peace talks to reach the present crucial stage and cautioned that in the political stage, Nagas cannot afford to commit mistakes. “Now it is 18 years talking about Naga political solution. Only this time we have achieved this. We are confident that it will provide enduring relationship and peaceful co-existence of the two entities (India and Nagas). We will not be under India but we should not be totally separated from each other,” he said. Muivah pointed out that just as the Indians have finally recognized the rights of the Nagas, the Nagas must also appreciate their difficulties. “Although we are right, we must not totally separate from each other as in divide and rule policy because it will be very dangerous for the Indians. We must understand that,” he said. While the NSCN leader did not divulge the contents of the agreement, Muivah said political negotiation is all about “give and take” and that Nagas too should not expect 100 percent of their demands to be fulfilled. He assured that the competencies will be worked out and before long these will be out. “Have no fear, Nagas will exercise their rights on the competencies,” Muivah assured the gathering, which included school children. The General Secretary took the reconciliatory path and said it was time for Nagas to come together and understand each other and work out what is best for Nagas. Taking the opportunity, Muivah gave a clarion call that the time has come to understand each other no matter the past. “How many groups, factions are there…no matter what, the past is past. The best time is today, how can we understand each other?” Muivah stated. He said problems will be there unless the different Naga political groups forgive each other before man and God. “Yes! Come on. Before God and before man, we will forgive each other. This is our policy now; this is our attitude towards any group, tribe or nationality. I am talking like this before the presence of Naga people here.” Muivah also said Nagas should forge friendly relations with their neighbours. “We have a lot of problem with our neighbours, the Assamese, Arunachalees, the Meiteis and others. We are ready to understand them, not through physical confrontation but through mutual understanding, because that is the only way to solve the problem and co-exist as neighbours, he said. He also appealed the Kuki, Simte, Kom, Gangte, Zomi, Paite, Baite, Hmar and other tribes in Manipur that unless we understand ourselves we will destroy ourselves. “We have the same future,” he stated. Muivah paid tribute to the past leaders of the Naga National Council (NNC) namely AZ Phizo, Imkongmeren, Khodao Yanthan and others for leading the Naga people and taking the right decision that ‘Nagas will be on our own and will decide our own future.’ “When the world was changing; it was the right decision in the right time which the Naga people took under leadership of those people,” he stated. Muivah acknowledged the leaders for the decision to make ‘Nagaland for Christ’ as the leading principle. “We must be thankful to the leaders of the past; they have given everything, even their life. We must honour them eternally.” -MExN"
"19","ENSF to Begin First Phase of Agitation Against Nagaland Govt","August 12","The Eastern Naga Students’ Federation (ENSF) is set to begin the first phase of its agitation against the Nagaland state government’s failure to “justify” the “deprivation of 25 percent job reservation for the Eastern Nagas for the past 38 years” and its failure to fulfil certain demands. The first phase of the agitation will last for three days starting August 13. The decision was taken after the ENSF Federal Assembly was held on August 4 at Kiphire Town. A press note from the ENSF Vice President, Z Throngshe Yimchunger and General Secretary, Honang M Jessuhu accused the successive state governments in Nagaland of violating the right guaranteed under the Indian Constitution in delivering basic fundamental rights to Eastern Nagas. Expressing strong resentment, the ENSF said that it is also astonished as to why the Nagaland state government is still in a dormant state even after the federation had consecutively termed Nagaland as a “failed State” in delivering justice to its citizen. The federation also fails to understand as to why the state government is so adamant or reluctant to deliver basic justice demanded by the federation, it said. The ENSF added that lack of political will in the state government in attending the needs of the poorer section of the Naga society had distorted Nagaland beyond repair. The ENSF reiterated that if the reservation policy had been implemented efficiently in the past 38 years, equality would have existed in the state today. And if the state government is reluctant to fulfil the demand of the federation, then inequality will “continue to exist for another centuries and the state government itself shall be termed as the mother of all manipulation and deprivation,” it said. The ENSF further asserted that the federation is not demanding for a special privilege but a right guaranteed under the Article 16(4) of the Indian Constitution. The resentment shown by the ENSF is against the failure of the successive governments of Nagaland in implementing the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Indian Constitution to deliver justice to ‘backward tribes’ of the Eastern Nagas, it said. The ENSF also informed that as resolved during the 13th Federal Assembly, it has endorsed and empowered all the six federating units to carry out the proposed agitation in their respective jurisdiction starting on August 13. In this regard, it directed all the Eastern Nagas to “strictly adhere on any directives issued by the respective students union during the period of agitation.” The ENSF further informed that once the agitation is kicked off, the federation would not entertain any invitation from the state government on the issue but “shall process for rendezvous at the highest level.” “Hence, in the event of any untoward incidents, the state government shall  be solely held responsible,” it cautioned. -MExN"
"20","RTI Plea Seeks Details of Naga Accord from MHA","August 11","As the Congress and chief ministers of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh question the ‘shroud of secrecy’ over the Centre-NSCN (IM) accord signed last Monday, an RTI application has been moved from Assam asking the Union home ministry for details of the “historic” agreement. Assam Pradesh Congress Committee secretary Bibhuti Bhushan Borthakur on Thursday sent a letter to the home secretary seeking details of the agreement signed between interlocutor for Naga talks RN Ravi and NSCN (IM) general secretary T Muivah. The letter sought to know why the signed agreement was not made public so far. Though sources indicated that such requests can always be turned down as the Right to Information Act exempts the government from making disclosures that can impinge upon national security, the home ministry may have to perforce reject this as it knows little about the terms of the “framework agreement” signed on Monday. Ravi did brief home minister Rajnath Singh and home secretary LC Goyal explaining that it was only a “framework” to proceed with further negotiations. However this has done little to dispel confusion within the home ministry brass on the “agreed way forward”. The home ministry was forced to write to the interlocutor on Friday, seeking details of the accord and its impact on the ceasefire ground rules in force in Nagaland. This was after the Indian Army approached the home ministry for clarifications. -TNN"

Locals in Mizoram’s Vairengte village have asked state Governor Nirbhay Sharma to help remove an Indian Army Colonel to prevent “civil-military animosity and conflict” after the Colonel was arrested for the second time in a month by police due to his alleged violent behaviour, including threatening a local man with a knife. Colonel Ravinder Singh, who is posted at the Army’s Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS), was arrested by Vairengte police for threatening a man in a shop last week with a knife. He had been arrested and later charge-sheeted for allegedly assaulting a fellow-Colonel in the school campus a month before. The local unit of the Young Mizo Association, the state’s largest community-based organisation with members in bvirtually every household, on Monday submitted a letter to Governor Sharma asking that the Colonel be removed from the school and listed out complaints by villagers. These include the Colonel playing football outside church buildings during Sunday church services, moving around the village with guns, machetes and other weapons and terrifying residents, presenting gifts to women after they make it clear they do not want them and visiting them at odd hours in their shops, workplaces and even homes, knocking on locals’ doors late in the night and one time removing a porch light-bulb, and general public drunkenness. “Our young men have developed a sense of enmity against him,” the YMA wrote in the letter to Governor Sharma, adding the Colonel’s continued presence might lead to “unwanted commotion breaking out in the village”. -India Express"
"22","Key Link to Indo-China Pangolin Smuggling Arrested","August 10","By P Naveen Madhya Pradesh forest department arrested another key link in the Indo-China international pangolin smuggling racket from Mizoram. The accused, Laltlan Kunga, a resident of Kolasib district in Mizoram, was brought on transit remand to Madhya Pradesh and produced in Chhindwara court on Saturday. One kg of pangolin scales were confiscated from his house. Blood, meat and scales of pangolins are sold to traditional medical practitioners at a premium in south-eastern countries. Ritesh Sirotia, in-charge of state forest’s special task force (STF) wildlife crime, told TOI that Kunga is a mediator between pangolin traders in India and China. “We have identified two Myanmar nationals, who are part of the poaching syndicate. Efforts are on to arrest them through Interpol,” he said. He was into this trade for last five years. “Kunga was getting commission from poachers in India and Myanmar. He was assigned with task of smuggling pangolins and its scales to China,” said the officer. As many as 38 people from seven states have been arrested, including 23 from Madhya Pradesh, seven from Maharashtra, two from Odisha, two from Andhra Pradesh, one from Chhattisgarh, two from West Bengal and one from Mizoram. Another key player of the gang has been identified as Amir Hussain Laskhar of Assam. He is absconding. Laskhar moved an application for anticipatory bail in the court. STF is also trying to arrest his female associate, Zobi Hmar, who is a tribal and part of the global smuggling ring. Last month, STF arrested Ashfaq Hussain, 63, a leather businessman from Odisha’s Berhampur area. A Kolkata-based marine engineer and a corporator involved in smuggling Indian pangolins to China and Vietnam were arrested during previous operations. Accused allegedly confessed to poaching and trafficking 100 pangolins from Madhya Pradesh to China in the last 12 months. Those arrested from Kolkata have been identified as Jamal Iqbal, 59, and his son Danish, 24, a marine engineer. Eleven others, including an independent corporator were arrested from Chhindwara district. “Tribals were used to pick up pangolins from forests and paid Rs 400-500 per kg for scales. It was then forwarded to Jamal between Rs 2,000 to Rs 4,000 and then shipped to China where it’s sold for around Rs 1 lakh and more. The operation to bust the pangolin racket was carried out by special task force (STF) of state forest department led by Chhindwara chief conservator of forests, Ritesh Sirothia, range officer Nitin Nigam and forest guard Chandra Sekhar Sharma. This ant-eating mammal with armour of keratin scales has been listed under Schedule 1 of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as an endangered species. Experts said, “If poaching continues, pangolin could go extinct.” In traditional Chinese medicine, roasted pangolin scales are used for detoxification of blood, draining pus, curing palsy and stimulating lactation while its blood is used to treat asthma, cancer and reproductive problems. -TNN"

"26","Tripura’s Ex-Royal Family Gets Possession of Neermahal Palace","June 10","A Tripura court has asked the state government to return the 85-year-old Neermahal, eastern India’s lone lake palace, to its builder – the state’s ex-royal family, officials said Tuesday. Tripura’s last king Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur built the majestic palace Neermahal in 1930 in the midst of Rudrasagar lake as his summer residence. The union forest and environment ministry had earlier declared Rudrasagar a national lake. “Following a petition from the royal family member Bibhu Kumari Devi, Judicial Magistrate (Senior Division) Gobinda Das on Monday asked the state government to hand over Neermahal to the royal family within two months,” a Tripura revenue department official said. The civil court also directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs.20.50 lakh annually with six percent interest since 2007. The official said that Kirit Bikram Kishore Debbarman, last coroneted prince and former Lok Sabha member (Congress) from Tripura, handed over the Neermahal to the Congress-led state government in 1974. According to the official, after the death of Kirit Bikram, his wife and former Congress minister Bibhu Kumari Devi asked the state government to return the palace to her. The state government led by Communist Party of India-Marxist led Left Front, turned down Bibhu Kumari Dev’s plea forcing her to file a suit before the court in 2008. Lawyer Debabrata Chakraborty, who defends the state government in the case, said that the state government would file a petition against the lower court judgment in the Tripura High Court. A blend of Hindu-Muslim architecture and about 400 metre in length, the royalty’s summer resort has 24 rooms with provisions for private quarters for the king and his family and retinue of servants. Tripura government has drawn up a Rs.50-crore plan to renovate and decorate the palace. The Neermahal, placed in the centre of the 5.3 sq km Rudrasagar lake, is one of Tripura’s favourite tourist destinations, 55 km west of here. The state government also built big tourist lodges there for the tourists. The ‘Mukta Manch’(open forum), a forum of environmentalists, intellectuals, academicians and renowned citizens, had demanded to publish a white paper on the status of Rudrasagar and Neermahal, second of its kind in India after lake palace in Rajasthan’s Udaipur. “We have urged Chief Minister Manik Sarkar to personally intervene into the matter and take suitable action to protect the heritage building,” said ‘Mukta Manch’ convener and writer, Arun Nath. “The central government had sanctioned Rs.1.6 million for afforestation around the Rudrasagar area, but the forest department diverted the money,” Nath alleged. He said the palace and lake still draw thousands of visitors every year despite the poor condition of the lake which has become shallow because of heavy deposit of silt. At the end of several hundred years of rule by 184 kings, on October 15, 1949, the erstwhile princely state Tripura came under the control of the Indian government according to a merger agreement signed between Kanchan Prabha Devi, then regent maharani, and the governor general of India. The merger agreement made it obligatory for the Tripura government to continue the sponsorship of several temples run earlier by Hindu princely rulers. And it continues to do so to this day. According to the 1949 merger agreement, Neermahal is the personal property of the royal family."
"27","Dibrugarh Among Top Ten Offbeat Indian Cities to Settle in","June 06","Recently, a Bengaluru based travel and tourism website Thrillophilia.com has listed Dibrugarh as one of the ten top Offbeat Indian cities to settle in, if one prefers a life away from the hustle-bustle of a big metropolis. The other such cities in the list include Bhopal, Ranchi, Chandigarh, Surat, Jaipur, Nagpur, Kochi, Kozhikode and Bhubaneswar. Dibrugarh, developed in the British-ruled Assam and considered a premier township in North-East India since the late nineteenth century due to its commercial importance centering around tea, coal, oil, cane and timber based industries, railway and riverine communication connecting it to the erstwhile Calcutta port and also as the first medical township of North-East India, suffered nature’s fury in the form of severe flood and erosion from the mighty Brahmaputra. However, since the last six decades, the river-bank at Dibrugarh remains the unchanged, owing mainly to the effective anti-erosion measures taken by the respective governments. Modern Dibrugarh today is a much sought-after destination for the foreign and also domestic tourists, who wish to rejuvenate themselves amidst the serenity and tranquility of the lush green tea gardens with the irresistible aroma of the Assam tea and also amidst the wild flora and fauna in the close vicinity. Moreover, corporate giants ONGC, OIL, upcoming BCPL, IOC etc., with their offices and installations around, better rail, road and air connectivity and also medical facilities available in the city act as major contributing factors for the growth of the city into a major urban centre of eastern India today. However, Dipankar Sharma, general secretary of the Assam Rail Passengers’ Association has said that only half the potential for development of railway services in and around Dibrugarh seems to have been utilised so far. “Local DMU services in Guwahati and Dibrugarh has been in our list of demands since long and super-fast trains connecting Dibrugarh with Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Katra in J&K and Puri is the need of the hour,” he said. Besides tourist information’s centers and tourist friendly amenities need to be geared up, Sharma said. -AT"
"28","Northeast India: A Place in The Clouds","June 04","By Deepa Gupta An unprecedented road trip from Assam to Meghalaya and Mizoram turned out to be a heady mix of serenity, sanguinity and spontaneity “I have booked you on a flight to Guwahati,” said Puneet, my friend, over phone, “And from there we shall be on a road trip across the Northeast right up to Mizoram.” Unbelievable, I had thought to myself then. With bomb threats and terror most of the time, this trip would never be possible. And yet, it started taking shape. I landed at the Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport on a humid afternoon to be greeted by my travel partners. And therein began my fascination with the topographical wonders of the land of the Seven Sisters, of which I was to explore three – Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram. Dotted by hills, the city of Guwahati appeared quite like any other. It was later, when we decided to explore the city, that the noise, the bustling, the slow crawling traffic, the non-hurried pace of life, all began to unfold. Amidst all this, the saving grace was the quietly flowing Brahmaputra. The serenity of this unfathomable river remains mystical. On our way to Tezpur the next morning after Kamkhya Temple, the drive in the gypsy began to get beautiful by the kilometre. The plains were spread in a lush green cover and there were no vehicle besides ours. There were strict instructions to not stop anywhere in between (and that meant to not even stop for pictures) and to maintain speed. The occasional huts and thickets of bamboo trees around them were a sight. The open expanse of vast green during the monsoon had wrapped the entire land in a tender fresh hue. Even as I shut my eyes to capture the immense beauty in my mindscape, the almost magical moments were cut short by the abrupt breaking of the vehicle. Heavy spiked chains were spread on the road at the entry point to Tezpur and then at every short distance throughout the city. A bomb had exploded in a vegetable vendor’s basket just a few minutes before and men in olive greens manned the city, guarding every nook and corner. But the tranquil surroundings of the army mess, the piping hot dal served for dinner and the neat, cool rooms, more than made up for the day long drive. A quiet, quaint little town, Tezpur has hardly any shops and it appeared to be sparsely populated. As we approached the Dah Parbatia temple, the ruins at first appeared nondescript. The ASI protected monument with sculpted images of goddesses Ganga and Yamuna on its gates with garland in hand and the Shiva linga in the main sanctum stood on a raised platform amidst the silent greens. From there to Agnigarh and the heat had begun to take its toll. The site of romance between Usha (daughter of asura Banasura) and Anirudha (grandson of Lord Krishna) was simplistic and minimal with a panoramic view of the Brahmaputra. A a cool drink from the tiny refreshment centre atop the hillock felt good. As per the planned itinerary, the road trip would now divert towards Mizoram. As we moved from Tezpur back to Guwahati and towards Shillong, the drive became a bit tiring. As the gypsy sped along the NH 40, the nip in the air grew strong and soon Shillong appeared in full view with distinctively flatter hills as compared to the high and mighty mountains in Uttaranchal and Himachal. The army guest house in Shillong provided much warmth with its artistic woodwork and old world English charm. The next morning was cold and cloudy. We first went to Ward’s Lake, where red lotus bloomed in abundance and then the Rhino Heritage Museum which was all about the history of Shillong; and soon we were speeding towards Silchar. The countryside changed from hills to plains to little hills all along this route. We were also now in a safer zone and taking pictures became easier. When I got off to click the tribal woman as she collected the gladioli, she smiled when she saw the camera in my hand. We were now on NH 44 and Jaintia Hills soon welcomed us. The neatly manicured tea plantations came in full view on both sides of the road. The plains thengave way to rivulets and mountains thickly covered with dense forests with not a single barren one. And then came a point on this highway from where you got a view of Bangladesh. Suddenly the boundaries ceased to exist. What borders are we talking about when we can see one country from right across our land? All along NH 54 (that connects Aizawl to the rest of the country through Silchar), the lone vehicle in hills with a winding road in the middle of a thicket, did become a bit scary at times. And the hairpin bends seemed unending with a few enchanting sights – a wild gladioli field in the middle of nowhere! The six hour long hill drive had the head spinning and the body tiring. So much for a road trip, I thought. The sun veiled the huge mountain dotted with houses even as the clouds played peek-a-boo in the clear blue sky. Deafening silence greeted us. The beauty of Aizawl was captivating. Stuffed paranthas with butter made for the perfect late lunch in the verandah and as evening began to descend, the chill forced us inside even as mist enveloped the hills from all sides. What struck me about the kaleidoscopic markets in Aizawl city was that the shops were all, entirely manned by women. Even the security at the mall comprised only women. And not a single readymade clothes shop for women had trial rooms! “Where can I try this on?” I asked. “Right here”, said the woman at the counter. The matriarchal set-up was as intriguing as insightful. At the vegetable market you had everything from pulses to spices to veggies and fruits. And of course, creepy crawlies! Of all kinds, variety, shape, sizes, being sold by the kilo. Most women were dressed in the traditional attire and smoking. A pretty young woman in Levis’ puffed away a Marlboro nonchalantly while selling kidney beans. This could happen only in Mizoram, my friend said. Later that evening, as I ventured into the verandah, shawl tightly wrapped around, I could hear choir singing in the hills. Music was the lifeline here. The next morning it rained and grew very cold. Forced to stay indoors, we feasted on the immense beauty of the hills with a bowl of Maggie noodles and coffee as I wondered whether I would ever come back to this lovely side of my country."
"29","Can Mizoram Really Top The List for Most Porn Views","August 06","According to a survey conducted by Pornhub in India, Mizoram tops the list of Page Viewed Per Visit as well as the Average Visit Duration. inkhel.com, a sports website in Mizoram, refuse to believe this for a number of reasons. Mizoram, like most of the other states of North-east India, does not have proper and efficient Internet service compared to the plain areas. The average Mizo has only been using Internet broadband since the last six years. The biggest Internet service provider in Mizoram is BSNL which does not provide direct IP. This makes it rather obvious that it is impossible to make an accurate count of visitors of any site. Inkhel.com supposedly does not have any visitor from Mizoram!! Considering that Inkhel.com is mostly in Mizo language, this is an unbelievable tale told by Google analytics. This website has about 40,000 visitors daily, and it does not take much logic to figure out that most of the visitors would be Mizos from Mizoram though there are a handful of visitors from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Guwahati and other places as well. That the Overview would show that there are no visitors of Inkhel.com from Mizoram tells of the pathetic condition of Internet service in Mizoram. Besides, the current condition of Internet in Mizoram does not really facilitate watching videos online. Very few privileged consumers can avail of the 4mbps plan which comes to about Rs. 1450 a month while the average user spends about Rs. 1000 a month on a plan with reduced services. Every consumer who uses BSNL broadband in Mizoram can attest for its irregularity and inefficiency, and mostly the excruciatingly slow speed of the Internet. Such circumstances make it impossible for users to watch videos. Inkhel.com has also noticed that interesting videos shared are viewed by only about 20% of visitors as the rest are most likely unable to. So, users prefer to download torrent videos instead of watching them online. And there is simply no way that Pornhub could count such downloads as part of their site traffic.  Some people surmise that the survey must have been done percentage wise. But, this too does not seem plausible. The total population of Mizoram is a little over 10 lakhs out of which Internet users would hardly number up to a lakh. Users who have access to Internet with a tolerable speed are mostly concentrated in and around Aizawl. And it would be a very generous suggestion to say that such users would be around 3000 or 4000 if a headcount was to be made. They amount upto just 0.3 to 0.4 % of the total population. According to Pornhub, viewers from Mizoram mainly go for the Indian Sex category. This, again, is rather unbelievable. Most of the Mizo people who do watch porn do not watch Indian sex as they prefer foreign ones. This is evident from the CD Video libraries which were in vogue just some few years ago. These libraries never stacked Indian sex videos. Inkhel.com, therefore, asserts with conviction that the survey conducted by Pornhub is greatly flawed, and not to be believed. Source -inkhel.com"

We chat Miss Popular and Reliance Digital Miss Multimedia. NET: Congratulations Rewati! Being one of the top 10 finalists in India’s most prestigious fashion pageant-Femina Miss India 2015 along with bringing home the coveted title of Miss Multimedia, how has the entire experience been? RC: Thank you so much. It all happened because of everyone’s love and support. Winning the desirable subtitles of Miss India Reliance Digital Miss Multimedia as well as We Chat Miss Popular, besides being in the Top 10 finalist of fbb Femina Miss India 2015, was like something out of a dream for me. NET: How would you like to describe yourself? RC : That’s not an easy question for me as I have never described myself. The few close friends I have, says I am friendly outspoken but choosy when it comes to building relationships. They say I am focused, driven by firm determination, logical reasoning and confidence. To my family, I am a fearless angel, always helpful, disciplined and obedient. Though this may not summarize me as a person, but I agree to the observations made. Frankly speaking, I know I have not changed, but yes, I have become more matured and responsible now. NET: How did modelling happen? Was it a planned endeavour or a chance encounter? RC: I was born and brought up in the small town of Haflong in Assam. As a child, I always dreamt of becoming an angel, making sure I behaved like one. It earned me loads of hugs and kisses from the elders of my family! (laughs). My father, Baburam Chetri, a Government employee of the state and my mother, Bina Chetri, a homemaker, has always encouraged me to do whatever I love, standing beside me like two strong pillars. My parents told me that ever since I was a little girl, I would stand in front of the mirror and visualize myself as an angel adorned with a crown of stars. I guess that was when the modeling bug slowly developed within me, getting stronger with every passing year. Even though I was studying law in NEF Law College under Gauhati University, modelling was always there in my mind and I was waiting for an opportunity to grab. Howver it all started in mid November 2014 when I first attended the auditions and got selected for former Miss India and Bollywood actor Neha Dhupia’s show and the journey continued from there onwards. I cannot say the tryst with the glamour world was sudden, but I must say it was not planned. Things just happened at a quicker pace in a better way, opening up opportunities and new doors for me. NET: What are the important qualities one should possess apart from good looks in this industry? RC: I believe that dedication, intelligence and professionalism are the essential qualities. Dedication is required because it really is not easy to remain in the industry unless you put your heart and soul into what you do. As the industry is extremely competitive. Intelligence, because to make proper choices from the sea of offers received is not easy as one bad choice can ruin your entire career. Lastly, without being professional you are nowhere in any industry! NET: Is Bollywood on the cards? RC: Bollywood is the dream of every artist in India and I am no exception. If I get suitable offers, I would definitely consider venturing in the magical world of Bollywood, but until then modelling will be my first priority. NET: Is there any social cause close to your heart? RC: Two social causes are very close to my heart- working for the underprivileged Children and Women and Youth Welfare. I am willing to work and raise fund for development of under privileged kids to support them with the basic necessities of life such as food and education and I urge all who can contribute to sponsor a child in their life time. Currently, I am associated with the Avas Foundation and Gorkha Youths of Guwahati (GYG) and helping the needy ones through organized channel. NET: Do you think being from Northeast, it has its share of disadvantages as believed by many? RC: When your dreams are big, the region you belong to or the language you speak can hardly become a barrier! This could be gauged from the number of talented reality show contestants and models that sprouted from our region such as Saurabi Devburma, Debojit Saha, Anamika Choudhury, Pradeep Gurung, Om Chetri, Rohit Sonar, Victoria Secrets famed model Monikongona Dutta, Model turned Bollywood actor Dipannita Sharma, Himakshi Agarwal, Sukalpa Das, Jantee Hazarika, Nangbia Chanda, Manik Paul to name a few. NET: What are your upcoming projects? RC: While I am talking to you, I just finished shooting a commercial for Byatikram Kindergarten School for Eastern India. I have also committed to Gorkha Youths of Guwahati (GYG) to shoot for Guwahati Goes Filil which is in lines of Resham Filili, a popular video in Nepali. I have already endorsed Topaz- a five star facility lounge, besides being the Goodwill Ambassador for Shailo Prabaho- a Bengali daily news paper published from my home town Haflong. My maiden music video album ‘Tumi Mur’ directed by Deepak Dey and produced by Dream House Production is also releasing soon. Overall it appears to be a jam-packed year for me with various projects decorating my diary (smiles). NET: Your message to the aspiring models from the region? RC: To all the aspiring models I would like to say that if you can dream it you can definitely make it too. Work hard, be genuine and dream big. The doors of opportunities are always open. Modelling is not easy as it looks, but if you have the dedication and commitment you definitely can make it happen."
"31","Mizoram Leads The Way in Porn Watcher’s List","August 04","As per a survey conducted by Pornhub.com, one of the world’s largest adult websites, Mizoram is marching ahead of other Indian states on internet porn access. However, the data doesn’t include the 10 other websites, such as YouPorn and RedTube, that make up the entire Pornhub network. Delhi occupied the second spot whereas Maharashtra stood at number four in watching porn websites. Apart from Mizoram, three other Northeastern states- Nagaland, Meghalaya and Assam are in the list that lead in watching porn sites. While most of us don’t openly talk about porn and sex, the words itself attract the attention of almost everyone across the globe. Condemning the culture, the government of India has recently ordered blocking of more than 800 porn websites in the country. The government’s move has been criticised harshly with some even calling it ‘Talibanisation’ of India. On a world wide basis, it is said that India ranked at the fifth spot in number of visitors to the porn website. The Government of India has banned access to at least 857 websites it considers pornographic. By order no. 813-7/25/2011-DS (Vol.-V), the department of Electronics and Information Technology has asked the Department of Telecom to notify internet service providers to block access to 857 URLs, under the provision of Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 as the content hosted on these websites relate to morality, decency as given in Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India. This comes after the Supreme Court refused to order a ban on pornographic websites saying such an order would impinge on freedom."
"32","Sweet Sound of Success","August 03","By Sanghamitra Goswami Raised in a humble joint family in Assam’s Sivasagar district, Bollywood’s talented sound mixer Debajit Changmai has made the Northeast proud with his numerous achievements. National award winner and three consecutive IIFA awardee, Debajit has become an inspiration for the young people of our region. Recently, bagging the prestigious IIFA award this year in the sound mixing category for the film ‘Haider’, Debajit believes that there is no shortcut to success. Expressing his feelings on winning the coveted award, he humbly shares, “Though winning an award is never in a person’s mind while immersed in his work, it can’t be denied that an award gives recognition to the person as well as his work in respective fields.” The growing up years with his family, especially his mother always encouraging him to fly towards his dreams, Debajit came to Guwahati in 1996 to try something different from the usual norm. Being fresh out of college, initially he was clueless when it came to choosing a career.” “I would frequently visit Jyoti Chitraban to watch the recording sessions there and would find myself completely immersed in these sessions. Call it my destiny or good luck, at that precise moment when I was unsure of which direction to follow in my life, the Jyoti Chitraban Film and Television Institute in Guwahati happened in the year 1999. I got selected in their first batch itself and thus began a journey of my tryst with sound mixing. Today whatever I have achieved in life, Jyoti Chitraban has a mammoth role to play in shaping the person I have become,” says Debajit. Though it is not necessary to receive technical training in order to bring out the hidden creativity of a person, Debajit believes that professional training does helps check in transforming a coal into a diamond. Doorway to Bollywood: After receiving his formal training in sound mixing, Debajit decided to give Bollywood a shot. With dreams of a new life soaring high, he went to the city of dreams. “When I came to Mumbai for the first time, I didn’t had an identity of my own. I had to introduce myself as well as my region to the peple I met. There was very less awareness about Northeast then among the people living outside the region then. Searching for appropriate works, I frequented as many studios as I could, meeting different people from various fields of the glamour industry. After a hard toil of six to seven months and making rounds of numerous studios, my stars finaly moved into a better position. Soon in the year 2002, I landed my first job as an assistant mixer in renowned Indian filmmaker, producer and actor, V. Shantaram’s studio based in Mumbai. I assisted under Hitendra Ghosh, a talented sound mixer himself and got the opportunity to polish my abilities. It was a great learning experience for me.” Debajit who worked in Shantaram’s studio till 2006, never had to look back ever since making a mark in the veteran’s studio. Based in Mumbai now, Pyaar Ke Side Effects produced under the banner of Pritish Nandy Communications , was Debajit’s first stint in Bollywood as an individual sound mixer. As time elapsed, his work received appreciation among the film fraternity and soon offers started flowing to him. From working as a sound re-recording mixer in wonderful movies like Dasvidaniya to Kaminey, Debajit has come a long way with his hard work and dedication. Speaking to the aspiring youths of the region who wants to make it big in the glamour world, Debajit says, “Though I do not consider myself to have reached a point where I can advise someone, but being in this field for a long period of time, I would like to share a couple of things to our aspiring youths. The first and foremost thing to understand is that without the virtue of hard work, passion and extreme dedication, it is not possible to scale heights in this industry.” He says that being a very demanding industry, many a times one will be required to forego his personal life to accommodate the hectic schedule of the industry. “Though I do not deny that there arrives certain low moments sometimes, yet at the end of the day when you return home, the satisfaction of doing something you are fond of, vanquishes every shred of frustration! The only thing one should remember is that – Venture into this world only if you live and breathe your work,” he further adds. A Peek into the Future:  So what’s next for this talented sound mixer? “Well, I recently concluded working for ABCD2 and Bajrangi Bhaijaan. In the coming time, there are several projects lined up for Imtiaz Ali, Anurag Basu among others.” Thus, it could be concluded that though there was a time when people didn’t have much idea about Northeast, now the scenario has changed a lot. Talents from the Northeast region are getting recognized for their work in both national and global platforms. People like Debajit Changmai, Amrit Pritam, Reema Kagi, etc. are living examples of this. We only hope the saga of success continues!"

"34","Forbidden Feelings of Queer Hearts","July 25","By Sanghamitra Goswami Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender (LGBT). These are the four hush-hush words that are a taboo in our country. With homophobia being very much prevalent in the country, life becomes a daily struggle for the members of the LGBT community. Leaving a handful of the courageous rebel hearts, many shudders at the thought of coming out of the closet and be their true self as they fear of being ostracized by the society. All they want in life is to be loved and respected just as any other normal individual of our society. Being a part of the same universe, we are all equal. But then, why are they made the object of ridicule and forced to live dual lives? With the US Supreme Court legalising gay marriage across the country, the LGBT community in India is also praying for the day when India would look beyond one’s sexual orientation and accept everyone as equal. Indian Mythology and Sexuality: One would be amazed to discover the numerous instances of multiple gender combinations and same sex unions in various Hindu and Vedic scriptures. From the depiction of several images of same sex lovemaking in Kamasutra, the Indian treatise on love, to tales of Lord Krishna taking the Mohini avatar for Arjuna’s son Iravan, homosexuality was not a rare phenomenon in ancient India. Instead, alternative sexuality was indeed an integral part of the societal framework then. One of the most known queer tales of that era was that of King Drupad’s daughter, Shikhandi. Born as a daughter initially, King Drupad was embarrassed to find out that his wife delivered a baby girl instead of a boy. Shielding himself from social stigma, Drupad kept the gender identity of his daughter as a secret and started raising Shikhandi as a boy. When it was time for Shikhandi to get married, the king married her to a girl. On their wedding night, when the bride discovered the reality of Shikhandi’s sexuality, she refused to consummate her marriage and returned to her maternal home. Dejected and forlorn, Shikhandi witnessed the sorrow of her parents and decided to end her life in a nearby forest. Just then a Yaksha named Sthunakarna appeared before her and moved by Shikhandi’s plight, donated his male organs to her and accepted her female organs in return. Ever since then, Shikhandi had transformed into a man who was able to create life outside him. Though Shikhandi was happy with his new found identity, he would often be haunted by the demon of identity crisis- Who was he? Was he a male or a female or was he both? If he has a child someday, will it be his or the Yaksha’s? The questions were endless for him with no definite answers. Hence, the question arises- If different gender combinations and same sex feelings were recognised as an integral part of Ancient India, why is homophobia such a prevalent fear in our modern day society? Naked Reality: While some people regard homosexuality as an unnatural sexual behaviour, various scientific researches shows that homosexuality is a normal variation of human sexuality just like heterosexuality and is not a disease. Contrary to popular belief that early childhood experiences can lead to development of such an alternative sexuality which could be corrected by psychological interventions, there is in reality no solid evidences proving the belief. In fact, people have very less or almost no control over their sexual preferences. Recalling his early struggles as a small boy, noted fashion designer of Assam, Chow Poran Gogoi shares, “When I was a little kid, I enjoyed playing with dolls and kitchen sets more than cars and robots. Whenever my folks at home would go to sleep, I used to sneak out to the dressing table and try on the various cosmetics lying there. As I reached around ninth or tenth standard in school, I slowly started realising that something feels very wrong inside me. I was uncomfortable with my body and to my initial confusion, I realised I get attracted to guys more than girls. The realisation scared me, as I had no one to confide to. As time passed the realisation grew stronger and inner conflicts revolving around my identity started disturbing me a lot. So, I decided to visit a counsellor and find out the real cause behind such feelings.” Poran remarks that after visiting the counsellor, he became more confident about himself and started researching on what homosexuality is all about. With mixed emotions in his heart, he decided it was time he divulge his true self before his family. “On finding out about my homosexuality, my brother and sister-in-law were furious and disowned me. Unable to bear the continuous jibes thrown at me, my sister left the home along with me and soon we started living in our own apartment. My sister has a huge role to play in my life. She stood by me when my own people disowned me. Some people say being gay or a lesbian is a personal choice, but then who wants to be the centre of all jokes if one was given a chance at choices? Being different doesn’t mean, someone is an aberrant of nature. It’s easy to humiliate someone who is different from you in certain aspects but it is not easy to live a pretentious life trying to be someone you are not. In my case, I was lucky enough to have a sister and group of friends who always stood by me, but there are many out there who are leading dual lives, killing their souls everyday just to stay ‘normal’ in our society. My heart goes out to these people.” The Extreme Step: Though popular celebrities like Elton John, Robbie Williams, Kristen Stewart etc are loved by people irrespective of being gay, lesbian or bi-sexual, however life is not easy for an ordinary human being from the LGBT community. Due to the force exerted on the individuals by their family, sometimes people with same-sex feelings gets married but secretly keeps seeing their partners even after marriage. As a result, three lives suffers, because of an unjustifiable decision on the part of family members who assumes a marriage to the opposite sex may cure their son/daughter of this ‘abnormality’. Adriana Sangmai, hailing from Meghalaya who was in a lesbian relationship with her partner Zubaira says, “Way back in 2009, I went to Delhi for my further studies. On my stay there, I became friends with Zubaira, who was my College senior and soon we fell in love with each other. Though my parents were furious at me initially, later they supported my decision and welcomed her as a part of our family. However, complications cropped in our relationship, when Zubaira’s family started opposing her relationship with me. One day, her brothers suddenly came to our flat, kicked me on my face and took her back with them. Every time I tried contacting her after that incident, they would snatch away the phone from her and threaten to kill me. It continued for a month and soon unable to bear the mental trauma of the entire incident, my girlfriend resorted to the extreme step and hung herself. I have lived with that memory every day since that incident. What was our fault? We only loved each other. The only ‘mistake’ was that we belonged to the same gender.” It may be cited here that same sex sexual activity is illegal in India under section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and is punishable by law resulting upto life imprisonment. Unlike countries like Norway, Ireland, etc India has not recognised same sex marriages as of now. Transcending Gender Boundaries: Various ambiguity hovers round the subject of Transgender among the general public. Basically, transgender is the state of one’s gender identity or gender expression not matching one’s assigned sex. The term transgender is an umbrella term which includes various overlapping categories such as transsexual, cross-dresser, genderqueer, androgyne and bi-gender. According to the law, Transgenders are legally regarded as a third gender and is entitled to enjoy rights such as right to life, right to vote, reservations in education and government jobs among many. Shedding light on transgenders, Bidhan Baruah, the first transgender in Assam to be given admission in Gauhati University under a transgender quota notes, “Irrespective of the various divisions under transgender, as far as common notion goes in many cases, he/ she is regarded as a eunuch. I believe with proper awareness programmes, such generalisations will be eradicated and create a healthy queer-friendly society.” Bidhan who has always felt like a woman’s soul being trapped in a man’s body opines that every human being is entitled to the right to life by virtue of his birth irrespective of his sex organs. “ A person should be regarded as a human being no matter how different he/she is from other people. Ever since I hit puberty, I knew I wanted to live my life as a girl. In my case, in what appears to be a historic judgement, the Supreme Court of India has recognised me as a female. Though my sex reassignment surgeries which were going on, came to a halt due to financial crisis, I am positive that soon I will be able to earn my own bread and butter and continue my treatment. The day that happens will be undoubtedly the happiest day of my life,” exclaims Bidhan. But not everyone is supportive of sex change surgeries. A banker by profession, Bishnu Pritam* says, “I see a lot of gays and lesbians overtly talking about their sexuality nowadays. But that will only mislead the younger generations creating chaos in the society. As for people going for sex operations are concerned, God made us in a certain way and altering one’s body is equal to disrespecting God.” However, contradicting Bishnu, Alex Lhamu, a resident of Nagaland says, “Every human being has the right to live the life they want. If one’s existence itself is making him suicidal and depressed, then he/she has every right to accommodate changes in their life. It’s a matter of personal choice and by defaming and throwing slurs on someone just because of their sexual preferences, we only prove our degraded mentality. No one becomes a gay, lesbian or a eunuch by their own choice. Its something that happens naturally. So instead of humiliating them, embracing them as our own would be a better option for our society.” Good news for the LGBT community Metropolitan cities in India such as Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata have a well flourishing gay community. But things are not the same in other parts of the country. In many regions, the LGBT people have to face constant exclusion from various sections of the society because of their alternative sexual preferences. It has become a constant struggle of life for many, with various occurrences of harassment against these people falling into deaf ears majority of the times. However, with the changing wheels of time and various initiatives from different quarters, proper awareness about this minority group has been catching up among the people. As a good news to the LGBT community, India gets Manabi Bandopadhyay as its first transgender College Principal recently. On a similar note, Jorhat College (Amalgamated) becomes the first college in India to openly accept transgender students. Talking about various initiatives undertaken for the LGBT community, Minakshi Bujarbaruah, co-founder of Xukia, a collective formed with the vision of creating a more queer friendly Assam states, “Though violence against the LGBT people was always present, it is only in the recent years that such cases has been reported. In terms of Northeastern context, as of now we still haven’t received a space where people feel comfortable about speaking on this topic. Thus in spite of being subjected towards violence and abuse, majority of the cases goes undocumented. On top of that as the Section 377 of our Indian Constitution does not allow for same sex union, oppression and police atrocities had to be faced by these people. And by violence, it not only refers to physical violence but also mental suffering caused as a result of family pressure. Thus, awareness is very much essential to bring down the rate of violence. Since we are a queer collective network, we see that human rights of the LGBT community does not get violated. Regarding our awareness building programmes, it happens at multiple levels such as reading circles, media sensitisation programmes, LGBT film festivals, pride parade among many.” Hence, the time has come to shed off our homophobic inhibitions and treat everyone as a human being first. Certain names have been changed to protect privacy."
"35","Hitchhiking from Bulgaria to India","July 20","This is one of the few things that you would definitely want to add to your bucket list: hitch-hike to a faraway place, with nothing but a paper map to guide you through.  An expedition of this kind is the perfect breather from the cold and distant virtual world in which all of us live in. Boris Kanev and Marta Samalea, turned this into reality, when the duo decided to hitch-hike all the way from Bulgaria to India without boarding on a plane or using of a smart phone. All they had was a DSLR, netbook and an ebook to document their journey. The couple travelled across  Asia in 511 days and entered India via Myanmar . They however, made an effort to stay connected with the world by regularly updating their blogs and with the ‘ancient’ Nokia phone informed their parents about their location now and then. To get around places all they used was a map. Along their way they also adopted a kitten named, Burma for company. According to the couple owning a phone nowadays is more inclined to comfort and aesthetics which overshadows necessity. “Naturally, when we are offline we have more questions than answers, we look around, write and draw the thoughts that come. Without having Google to reply straight away, getting information turns into something like a treasure hunt game,” Samalea writes on the blog. “After a very long and dusty road across Tibetan mountains, a few sleepless nights, we were tired and Marta had a bleeding leg due to an unfortunate encounter with a nasty dog. We walked for hours the streets of Dege searching for anyone who could exchange US dollars for Chinese yuan to cover the rabies vaccine and a few nights of hostel stay to rest. As laid back as our travel may seems,  it actually involves a lot of preparation.” Kanev told NDTV . Unfortunate incidents are something that nobody can escape when they head out on a journey of this nature. They said that getting a grip of the regional cultures was a far greater challenge than internet access. However, when it came to picking up languages the couple were quite adept. “During our first days in every country we usually gather useful words and phrases, write them down and try communicating. The result is usually a lots of fun and misunderstanding, but people most of the time find it cute because it shows interest in their place.”  writes Marta Samalea. -India Today"
"36","US Supreme Court Legalizes Same-Sex Marriage","June 27","Giving gay rights activists their biggest victory yet, the US Supreme Court ruled Friday that same-sex couples can marry nationwide and states cannot ban such marriages – an issue that divides America and India too. President Barack Obama, who come out in support of same sex marriage only three years ago in the face of fast-changing public opinion in the midst of his 2012 re-election campaign, hailed the apex court’s 5-4 ruling as “a victory for America”. Social progress sometimes comes in small increments, he said from the White House Rose Garden, “and then there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt”. “America should be very proud,” said Obama whose administration supported the challengers to the gay marriage bans in the apex court. Unlike India, where homosexuality is a criminal offence, same-sex couples can marry in 36 American states today, but federal appeals courts have been divided over whether states must allow same-sex couples to marry and recognize such marriages performed elsewhere. The 14 same-sex couples and two widowers who challenged gay marriage bans in Michigan, Tennessee, Kentucky and Ohio were just a few of the estimated 650,000 same-sex couples in the US, 125,000 of whom are raising children. Lawyers for the four states argued their bans were justified by tradition and the distinctive characteristics of opposite-sex unions. The issue, they said, should be resolved democratically, at the polls and in state legislatures, rather than by judges. The challengers included same-sex couples who wanted to marry, those who sought to have their lawful out-of-state marriage recognized, as well as those who wanted to amend a birth or death certificate with their marriage status. “No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy for the majority with four liberal justices."

Florence Romuonpui Hrangchal, a native of Manipur studying in Delhi’s Holy Child school, was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Wednesday morning where she was confirmed to be suffering from dengue. “The young girl was admitted to the hospital today (Wednesday) early in the morning and was confirmed to be suffering from dengue. Treatment was initiated but she could not be saved as her condition was serious and she was brought late,” a doctor at AIIMS said. He said the girl was suffering from high fever for almost a week but was not given proper medication. With the onset of monsoon, union Health Minister J.P. Nadda recently urged all hospitals and medical centres to upgrade their facilities to accommodate patients suffering from dengue. He had also made surprise checks at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Safdarjung Hospital to look into the initiatives taken by the hospitals."
"38","No Clean Chit to Maggi","August 06","India’s food safety regulator on Wednesday said Nestle India has not been given a clean chit regarding its popular Maggi noodles and that its ban order of June 5 was still operative despite a certified lab in Karnataka reportedly finding the snack to be safe. “It is clarified in the first instance that FSSAI has not given any clean chit regarding the safety of	Maggi Noodles,” the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India said in a statement, reacting to reports that a laboratory in Mysore had found the samples to be safe. The watchdog also said that Nestle India has not shared with it the details of the test reports from the UK and Singapore, which purportedly had said that samples of Maggi noodles tested in those countries were found to be safe for consumption. The statement said that the Food Safety Department of Goa had drawn five samples of Maggi noodles pursuant to a May 25 communication issued by the watchdog to all safety commissioners across the country. These samples, were initially sent for testing to the Food and Drugs Laboratory of Goa and upon examining the reports received on June 1, it was found that the permissible limit of lead had been wrongly taken 10 parts per million, against 2.5 parts per million, it said. The results reported by	the lab also did not specify the actual lead content in the samples after which clarifications were sought from the state’s food safety authority. “The	Food Safety Department of Goa subsequently sent one part of the said samples to the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore where the lead has been found to be within permissible limits,” it said. “But a perusal of the test results from CFTRI,	Mysore shows that the said samples have not been tested for MSG (mono-sodium glutamate),” it added. “In any case, the test results of	Goa samples had no bearing on the order dated 5th June, 2015 as the samples tested qua Goa were not assumed to be unsafe while passing the recall order by FSSAI. As such, the present test reports do not have any bearing on that order.” The statement also sought to clarify that out of five units where Nestle was manufacturing Maggi noodles, only one at the	Bicholim in Goa was catering to exports to eight countries. It also said four out of the five samples taken by Goa for testing were from this factory. Asked for the response regarding the reports from Goa, a Nestle spokesperson said the company had only received information on the matter via media reports that a lab approved by the food safety authority had found Maggi noodles to be compliant with the standards. “The matter is sub-judice and we cannot comment further,” the spokesperson added. The reference was to the ongoing hearing in the Bombay High Court. Maggi noodles had been banned on June 5 after allegedly high amount of lead and MSG were found in the samples. Following that, Nestle withdrew all the variants of the noodle, while continuing to maintain that its products were safe. -IANS"
"39","Lab Report: Maggi Meets Safety Standards in India","August 05","Samples of Maggi noodles tested at FSSAI-approved laboratory, Central Food Technology Research Institute (CFTRI) in Mysuru have revealed that levels of lead and monosodium glutamate in the instant noodles are within permissible limits. After the report, maggi lovers are upbeat with speculations that the instant noodles will soon be back in stores. There is nothing official about it, but speculations have started doing the rounds. CFTRI had tested five samples sent by Goa Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when Maggi was banned in June in the wake of findings in Uttar Pradesh and other states that the instant noodles brand had lead levels beyond permissible limits.  Goa FDA had sent the Maggi noodles samples to Mysore-based CFTRI for retesting of the safety of instant noodles after FSSAI expressed apprehensions on state FDA’s initial report, which had found lead within permissible limits. In June this year, Nestle had to take Maggi off the shelves, after few states decided to ban the noodles. FSSAI had also banned Maggi instant noodles terming them “unsafe and hazardous” for human consumption. FSSAI had also said that Nestle violated labelling regulations on taste enhancer ‘MSG’ and ordered company to submit compliance report on its orders. Meanwhile, Nestle India’s new chief Suresh Narayanan had said that bringing the instant noodles brand back to the market is his top priority as he sought to strike a conciliatory note with authorities."

"41","Muslims in Nepal Demand a Hindu State","August 13","In an unusual move, Muslims in Nepal have backed the ongoing campaign for reinstating the country’s erstwhile Hindu identity, saying they are more “secure” under a Hindu state than under a secular Constitution. “It is to protect Islam. I have opened my mouth demanding that Nepal be declared a Hindu state in order to protect my own religion,” said Amjad Ali, chairman of the Rapti Muslim Society, who is also involved in the protest programmes demanding a Hindu state in Nepal. CPN-UML CA member Anarkali Miya said she has personally experienced missionaries trying to influence people from other faiths to follow Christianity. “I believe Nepal should not adopt secularism. It will only create more problems in future,” Miya said. Udbudhin Fru, chairman of Muslim Mukti Morcha affiliated to the UCPN (Maoist), also admitted the growing influence of Christianity in Nepal. “Turning the country secular is nothing but a design to break the longstanding unity among Muslims and Hindus. So there is no alternative to reinstating the country’s old Hindu State identity in order to allow fellow citizens to live with religious tolerance,” Babu Khan Pathan, chairperson of the Rastrabadi Muslim Manch Nepalgunj, was quoted as saying by The Himalayan Times. “We don’t need a secular identity, but want to see the country called Hindu State as this ensures safety and security for all,” Pathan added and claimed that around 80 per cent of Muslims in Banke are in favour of Hindu State identity. Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal, a pro-monarchy party and some other pro-Hindu organisations have also been campaigning for reconverting Nepal to a Hindu state as the country plans to adopt a new constitution. The constitution writing process had proved to be a cumbersome work for Nepal’s ruling and opposition parties. For the last eight years, they have been vigorously arguing their differences over crucial issues including secularism and federalism. -PTI"
"42","44 Killed, More Than 500 Injured in China Blasts","August 13","At least 44 people were killed and over 500 injured in two massive explosives that ripped through a warehouse in China’s port city of Tianjin, destroying hundreds of cars, shattering window panes and with huge flames leaping into the night sky. Twelve fire-fighters were among those killed in the blast late Wednesday at the warehouse, which stores dangerous goods, in the Binhai New Area, Xinhua news agency reported. The first explosion occurred at 11.30 p.m. and was followed by a second more powerful blast, seconds later, BBC reported. A total of 520 people have been hospitalized, including 66 who are critically injured, rescuers said. Tianjin, about half an hour from Beijing by train, is home to 14.72 million people. Zhang, who lives a 10-minute-drive from the site, said the blast made the night sky as bright as it was in the daytime, reported China Daily citing sohu.com. A video clip of a witness showed that the heavy smoke covered the sky, and shortly after fires raged. There were loud bangs. Truck driver Hu Xiaoliang, 32, woke up on Wednesday night due to a ear-shattering blast which threw him away from beneath his truck, where he and his co-workers were resting. “It’s all black and smog, I can’t see anything inside. Some of my colleagues had even worse injuries,” an injured fire-fighter in his 20s told Xinhua. Smog billowed from the site. In a nearby apartment complex, the balconies of many apartment buildings were shattered. Du Wenjun never imagined that he would see a “mushroom cloud” outside the window of his home. Zhao Lirong, a 35-year-old businesswoman, was asleep when the blast blew off the windows and doors of her apartment, hitting her head, her son’s neck and her husband’s feet. Blood stains were splattered on the floors of hospitals that received injured patients. People rushed into the streets in their pyjamas, and some worried that an earthquake could occur. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have vowed to investigate the accident. Xi ordered authorities to spare no effort to treat the injured, search for the missing and contain the fire. Li urged authorities to intensify search and rescue operations. Hundreds of fire-fighters struggled to contain the flames. Around 1,000 fire-fighters and 143 fire engines were rushed to the warehouse. Xinhua reported that the volatility of the goods meant the fire is unpredictable and dangerous to approach. At least 200 armed police officers were deployed at the warehouse. China shut down supercomputer Tianhe-1A, which can perform 2.57 quadrillion computing operations per second, due to the blasts. Tianhe-1A is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. The shockwaves due to the blasts shattered windows at the centre and and led to the collapse of ceilings inside the building, according to the centre’s staff. -IANS"

He is also the president of the Indian National Science Academy and has published more than 270 research papers and two books. His first book, Survival Strategies, has been translated into Chinese and Korean. Why do these insects live collectively? What evolutionary benefits do they gain? Why does group living give an advantage over solitary life? Where some of the main topics of the studies. Much of the work focused on how a hierarchy is established in a nest and how a queen emerges from a population of wasps. According to Prof. Gadagkar the wasps hold a mirror to us and allow us to reflect on our own society. “It’s a moment of great pride,” said Prof Gadagkar on receiving the award. “When I was doing my research, insects were my passion but study on insect became my profession, I needed new hobby. So I decided to bring science and humanities together. It was part of my attempt to find best talents in both disciplines my relationship with Germany strengthened,” he said. It was this which made him founder chair of the Centre for Contemporary Studies, established at IISc in 2004. At this institute he brings together people from the IISc campus especially graduate students from different disciplines in humanities, including literature, art and music. “The ignorance that humanities and sciences had towards each other has now become a mutual disrespect. But the fact is science and humanities can’t operate in isolation. So at this institute, science students are exposed to idea like how poets communicate, how to bring out a newspaper, how history can solve current problems etc. The idea is to have scientists who can communicate like poets,” he said. Joern Rohde, Consul General of Germany said that Prof Gadagkar has been associated with Germany for more than 25 year now and he has contributed to academic and research cooperation, which is major of area of partnership between the two countries. “It is a great honour to award him the Cross of Order of the Merit,” he said -TNN"

"47","Can Mizoram Really Top The List for Most Porn Views","August 06","According to a survey conducted by Pornhub in India, Mizoram tops the list of Page Viewed Per Visit as well as the Average Visit Duration. inkhel.com, a sports website in Mizoram, refuse to believe this for a number of reasons. Mizoram, like most of the other states of North-east India, does not have proper and efficient Internet service compared to the plain areas. The average Mizo has only been using Internet broadband since the last six years. The biggest Internet service provider in Mizoram is BSNL which does not provide direct IP. This makes it rather obvious that it is impossible to make an accurate count of visitors of any site. Inkhel.com supposedly does not have any visitor from Mizoram!! Considering that Inkhel.com is mostly in Mizo language, this is an unbelievable tale told by Google analytics. This website has about 40,000 visitors daily, and it does not take much logic to figure out that most of the visitors would be Mizos from Mizoram though there are a handful of visitors from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Guwahati and other places as well. That the Overview would show that there are no visitors of Inkhel.com from Mizoram tells of the pathetic condition of Internet service in Mizoram. Besides, the current condition of Internet in Mizoram does not really facilitate watching videos online. Very few privileged consumers can avail of the 4mbps plan which comes to about Rs. 1450 a month while the average user spends about Rs. 1000 a month on a plan with reduced services. Every consumer who uses BSNL broadband in Mizoram can attest for its irregularity and inefficiency, and mostly the excruciatingly slow speed of the Internet. Such circumstances make it impossible for users to watch videos. Inkhel.com has also noticed that interesting videos shared are viewed by only about 20% of visitors as the rest are most likely unable to. So, users prefer to download torrent videos instead of watching them online. And there is simply no way that Pornhub could count such downloads as part of their site traffic.  Some people surmise that the survey must have been done percentage wise. But, this too does not seem plausible. The total population of Mizoram is a little over 10 lakhs out of which Internet users would hardly number up to a lakh. Users who have access to Internet with a tolerable speed are mostly concentrated in and around Aizawl. And it would be a very generous suggestion to say that such users would be around 3000 or 4000 if a headcount was to be made. They amount upto just 0.3 to 0.4 % of the total population. According to Pornhub, viewers from Mizoram mainly go for the Indian Sex category. This, again, is rather unbelievable. Most of the Mizo people who do watch porn do not watch Indian sex as they prefer foreign ones. This is evident from the CD Video libraries which were in vogue just some few years ago. These libraries never stacked Indian sex videos. Inkhel.com, therefore, asserts with conviction that the survey conducted by Pornhub is greatly flawed, and not to be believed. Source -inkhel.com"

RC: Thank you so much. It all happened because of everyone’s love and support. Winning the desirable subtitles of Miss India Reliance Digital Miss Multimedia as well as We Chat Miss Popular, besides being in the Top 10 finalist of fbb Femina Miss India 2015, was like something out of a dream for me. NET: How would you like to describe yourself? RC : That’s not an easy question for me as I have never described myself. The few close friends I have, says I am friendly outspoken but choosy when it comes to building relationships. They say I am focused, driven by firm determination, logical reasoning and confidence. To my family, I am a fearless angel, always helpful, disciplined and obedient. Though this may not summarize me as a person, but I agree to the observations made. Frankly speaking, I know I have not changed, but yes, I have become more matured and responsible now. NET: How did modelling happen? Was it a planned endeavour or a chance encounter? RC: I was born and brought up in the small town of Haflong in Assam. As a child, I always dreamt of becoming an angel, making sure I behaved like one. It earned me loads of hugs and kisses from the elders of my family! (laughs). My father, Baburam Chetri, a Government employee of the state and my mother, Bina Chetri, a homemaker, has always encouraged me to do whatever I love, standing beside me like two strong pillars. My parents told me that ever since I was a little girl, I would stand in front of the mirror and visualize myself as an angel adorned with a crown of stars. I guess that was when the modeling bug slowly developed within me, getting stronger with every passing year. Even though I was studying law in NEF Law College under Gauhati University, modelling was always there in my mind and I was waiting for an opportunity to grab. Howver it all started in mid November 2014 when I first attended the auditions and got selected for former Miss India and Bollywood actor Neha Dhupia’s show and the journey continued from there onwards. I cannot say the tryst with the glamour world was sudden, but I must say it was not planned. Things just happened at a quicker pace in a better way, opening up opportunities and new doors for me.

Dedication is required because it really is not easy to remain in the industry unless you put your heart and soul into what you do. As the industry is extremely competitive. Intelligence, because to make proper choices from the sea of offers received is not easy as one bad choice can ruin your entire career. Lastly, without being professional you are nowhere in any industry! NET: Is Bollywood on the cards? RC: Bollywood is the dream of every artist in India and I am no exception. If I get suitable offers, I would definitely consider venturing in the magical world of Bollywood, but until then modelling will be my first priority.

I am willing to work and raise fund for development of under privileged kids to support them with the basic necessities of life such as food and education and I urge all who can contribute to sponsor a child in their life time. Currently, I am associated with the Avas Foundation and Gorkha Youths of Guwahati (GYG) and helping the needy ones through organized channel. NET: Do you think being from Northeast, it has its share of disadvantages as believed by many? RC: When your dreams are big, the region you belong to or the language you speak can hardly become a barrier! This could be gauged from the number of talented reality show contestants and models that sprouted from our region such as Saurabi Devburma, Debojit Saha, Anamika Choudhury, Pradeep Gurung, Om Chetri, Rohit Sonar, Victoria Secrets famed model Monikongona Dutta, Model turned Bollywood actor Dipannita Sharma, Himakshi Agarwal, Sukalpa Das, Jantee Hazarika, Nangbia Chanda, Manik Paul to name a few.

I have also committed to Gorkha Youths of Guwahati (GYG) to shoot for Guwahati Goes Filil which is in lines of Resham Filili, a popular video in Nepali. I have already endorsed Topaz- a five star facility lounge, besides being the Goodwill Ambassador for Shailo Prabaho- a Bengali daily news paper published from my home town Haflong. My maiden music video album ‘Tumi Mur’ directed by Deepak Dey and produced by Dream House Production is also releasing soon.

"49","Mizoram Leads The Way in Porn Watcher’s List","August 04","As per a survey conducted by Pornhub.com, one of the world’s largest adult websites, Mizoram is marching ahead of other Indian states on internet porn access. However, the data doesn’t include the 10 other websites, such as YouPorn and RedTube, that make up the entire Pornhub network. Delhi occupied the second spot whereas Maharashtra stood at number four in watching porn websites. Apart from Mizoram, three other Northeastern states- Nagaland, Meghalaya and Assam are in the list that lead in watching porn sites. While most of us don’t openly talk about porn and sex, the words itself attract the attention of almost everyone across the globe. Condemning the culture, the government of India has recently ordered blocking of more than 800 porn websites in the country. The government’s move has been criticised harshly with some even calling it ‘Talibanisation’ of India. On a world wide basis, it is said that India ranked at the fifth spot in number of visitors to the porn website. The Government of India has banned access to at least 857 websites it considers pornographic. By order no. 813-7/25/2011-DS (Vol.-V), the department of Electronics and Information Technology has asked the Department of Telecom to notify internet service providers to block access to 857 URLs, under the provision of Section 79(3)(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 as the content hosted on these websites relate to morality, decency as given in Article 19(2) of the Constitution of India. This comes after the Supreme Court refused to order a ban on pornographic websites saying such an order would impinge on freedom."
"50","Why Naga Accord is Keeping Manipur on Its Toes","August 13","By Esha Roy Despite repeated assurances from the Union government that the territorial integrity of Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam will be maintained and the peace accord recently signed between the Centre and the NSCN (IM) will not affect these states, tension has been palpable in Manipur since August 3. Both Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh and Deputy Chief Minister and Home Minister of the state G Gaikhangam (himself a Naga) have maintained that they had been kept in the dark and had not been consulted before the signing. Any other month in any other year, the secrecy of the peace accord would have been enough to spark violent protests among the non-Nagas in the state – the dominant Meitei community who inhabit the four districts that constitute the Imphal valley, and Manipur’s third largest community the Kuki tribe. But despite headlines in Manipur’s local dailies and Manipuri sentiment being dominated by the present Inner Line Permit agitation and demand, underneath lies a slowly simmering anger about the peace accord. In 2001, the Centre had to quickly clarify the terms and conditions of the ceasefire signed with the NSCN (IM) as Imphal valley erupted in violent communal riots in protest against the ceasefire. The ceasefire was to be valid for all Naga area without territorial limits. Manipur reacted to it as an implicit threat on its territorial integrity – an acceptance on the part of the Indian Government that all Naga areas were considered one. The Chief Minister’s residence was attacked as was the Secretariat, government buildings were set afire and mobs ran amok. To this day the violence of the June 18, 2001 protests are marked as yearly anniversaries across the Imphal valley. There are four Naga districts in Manipur – Senapati, Ukhrul (where NSCN (IM) General Secretary Th Muivah hails from), Tamenglong and Chandel which cover vast expanses of Manipur’s land. The fear in 2001, as is today, is that the land will be handed over to Nagaland reducing Manipur to a shadow of a state. Even as Manipur waits and watches, Naga families who have been living in Imphal for decades have already begun considering moving out of the valley and relocating to their original districts and making contingency plans and “escape routes” in case communal riots break out in the near future. The Kuki Inpi – Manipur umbrella Kuki body – has meanwhile issued an open memorandum to the Prime Minister demanding that the peace accord be explained. The Kuki Inpi has said that the “criminal actions” of the NSCN (IM) needed to be addressed before the signing of the accord – a reference to the Naga-Kuki riots which had taken place in the early 90s in which 906 kukis were killed and 3,000 Kuki villages and 100,000 Kukis displaced by the Nagas. -Indian Express"

Expressing Concern Dkhar said that the concern authority should give a clarification on the matter as to why local students are not given admission, whereas students from outside are given more preference. Interestingly he said that the university never used to conduct entrance exams from time past, they used to base the admission of a student through the merit list but this change in the admission process by NEHU clearly shows that they have a hidden interest to give admission to outsiders instead of taking first preference towards the local students of the state. The FKJGP leader also said that they have decided to meet the Pro Vice Chancellor on Thursday, to discuss on the issue. Meanwhile, one of the students who was denied admission Ibarisha Lyngdoh Mawlong said, “This has greatly saddened me because when I came for admission the staff of NEHU told me that I am guaranteed to get the admission since there is no entrance exams and that everything is based on the merit list.” She said that the authorities at NEHU later informed her that she needs to appear the entrance exams. She added, “It’s very difficult to prepare a course  of 3 years in one week and on top of that during the entrance exams there was no proper checking done on the admit card or photo of the students appearing for the exams,” -Tsnl"
